targets by 2025 aimed to reduce stunting in children under five by 40%, maintain 
childhood wasting below 5%, halt obesity, cut anemia in women by 50%, lower low 
birth weight prevalence by 30%, and increase exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) 
within the first 6 months to 50%. These targets were extended to 2030, with all 
of them remaining as originally planned, but the EBF one (increased to 70%), 
wasting and overweight (both objectives set to eliminate them to negligible 
concern). Mexico is projected to achieve only one of the six nutrition targets 
(wasting) by 2025, falling far short of the stunting, low birth weight, anemia, 
and exclusive breastfeeding for the updated goals by 2030. This letter to the 
editor describes the most recent prevalence of malnutrition among mothers and 
children in Mexico. It discusses the challenges pregnant women and children 
under five years of age face exercising their right to good food, nutrition, and 
development. The authors reflect on the urgent need to make structural changes 
to achieve the global nutrition targets by 2030, highlighting the paramount 
importance of addressing the profound structural obstacles in Mexico and how 
Mexico's government must prioritize poverty reduction, reduce the marked 
inequalities, enhance the quality of nutritional care and healthcare 
infrastructure, and implement climate-resilient agricultural practices to 
address this pressing issue.",

Innovation Agency Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVES: To analyze factors related to stunting in Papua region.
METHODS: Secondary data from the 2021 Indonesian National Nutrition Status 
Survey were used in this study. Samples of 2,937 Papuan children under the age 
of two were gathered for the study. This study analyzed independent variables 
(type of residence, mother's age, marriage, mother's education, employment, 
wealth, child's age, gender, and early breastfeeding initiation (EBFI) with 
stunting. The relationship was analyzed using logistic regression tests.
RESULTS: Stunting is more common among children in Papua's rural areas than in 
urban (AOR 1.168, 95% CI, 1.128-1.209). Stunting is more common in children who 
mother do not work than in mothers who do (AOR 1.174, 95% CI, 1.142- 1.207). 
Stunting is more common in children aged 12-23 months compared to children <12 
months (AOR 3.381, 95% CI, 3.291-3.474). Compared to girls, boys are more likely 
to become stunted (AOR 1.348, 95% CI, 1,314-1,383). Children under the age of 
two who do not experience EBFI are at higher risk than those who have (AOR 
1.078, 95% CI, 1.050-1.106).
CONCLUSION: There are eight variables associated with stunting, namely 
residence, age of mother, mother's education, mother's occupation, economic 
status, child's age, gender, and EBFI. Prioritization of stunting interventions 
in Papua should be targeted at mothers who living in rural, having low 
education, and not doing early breastfeeding initiation.",

macronutrients. Proper growth and body maintenance depends on the quantity and 
quality of protein intake and proteins have thus been most crucial throughout 
evolution with hominins living in quite diverse food ecosystems. Developments in 
agriculture and food science have increased availability and diversity of food 
including protein for a rapidly growing world population while nutrient 
deficiencies resulting in stunting in children for example have been reduced. 
Nevertheless, the developing world and growing population needs more protein of 
high quality - with around 400 million tons per annum estimated for 2050. In 
contrary, protein consumption in all developed countries exceeds meanwhile the 
recommended intakes considerably with consequences for health and the 
environment. There is a growing interest in dietary proteins driven by the quest 
for more sustainable diets and the increasing food demand for a growing world 
population. This brings new and novel sources such as algae, yeast, insects or 
bacteria into play in delivering the biomass but also new technologies such as 
precision fermentation or in vitro meat/fish or dairy. What needs to be 
considered when such new protein sources are explored is that proteins need to 
provide not only the required amino acids but also functionality in the food 
produced thereof. This review considers human physiology and metabolism in the 
context of protein intake from an evolutionary perspective and prospects on 
future protein production.",

Jimma University, Jimma, Ethiopia.","BACKGROUND: Stunting in children is the term for reduced linear growth and 
development, which is frequently brought on by a persistently inadequate diet, 
recurrent infections and chronic diseases or poor health conditions. Apart from 
the classic covariates of stunting, which include diet and illness, the relative 
contribution of household air pollution to chronic nutrition conditions is least 
studied. Hence, this study is conducted to investigate the impact of household 
air pollution on the linear growth of under-five children in Jimma town, 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was employed to collect data from 280 
under-five children who lived in households using solid fuel (exposed group, 
n = 140) and clean fuel (unexposed group, n = 140). Height-for-age Z scores were 
compared in both groups over a 12-month follow-up period. The difference in 
differences estimators were used for comparison of changes in the height-for-age 
Z scores from baseline to end line in exposed and non-exposed groups. The 
independent effect of the use of solid fuels on height-for-age Z scores was 
analyzed through a multivariable linear regression model. Statistical 
Significances were declared at P < 0.05 and 95% CI level.
RESULTS: In an unadjusted model (Model 1), compared with the clean fuel type, 
the mean difference in the height-for-age Z score of children in households 
using solid fuel was lower by 0.54 (-0.54, 95% CI -0.97, -0.12, P = 0.011). The 
beta coefficient remained negative after adjusting for age and sex (Model 2 
-0.543, 95% CI -1.373, -0.563) and sociodemographic variables (Model 3: -0.543, 
95% CI -1.362, -0.575). In the final model (Model 4), which adjusted for wealth 
quantile, dietary practice, water, sanitation and hygiene status and household 
food insecurity access scale, the beta coefficient held the same and significant 
(beta: -0.543, 95% CI -1.357, -0.579, P < 0.001). Higher HAZ scores were 
observed among female child (β: = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.28, 0.69), Child with father 
attended higher education (β: = 0.304 95%CI: 0.304, 95% CI 0.19, 0.41) as 
compared to male gender and those who did not attend a formal education, 
respectively. In contrast, child living in households with poor hygiene 
practices had lower HAZ score (β: -0.226, 95% CI: -0.449, -0.003), P < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to indoor air pollution was inversely related to linear 
growth. Furthermore, sex, educational status and hygiene were found relevant 
predictors of linear growth. In such a setting, there is a need to step up 
efforts to design and implement public education campaigns regarding the health 
risks associated with exposure to household air pollution. Promoting 
improvements to kitchen ventilation and the use of improved cooking stoves, 
which will help to mitigate the detrimental effects of indoor air pollution on 
child growth impairment and its long-term effects.",

diversity and malnutrition, placing children's growth at risk. Children with 
growth disorders, such as stunting, are more likely to have poor cognition and 
educational performance, lower economic status, and an increased risk of 
nutrition-related chronic diseases in adulthood. Our study aimed to 
systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of cohort studies 
investigating the association between HFI and stunting in children aged 0-59 
months. Peer-reviewed and grey literature were systematically searched in 
electronic databases with no language or date restrictions. Two reviewers 
independently assessed the studies for pre-established eligibility criteria. 
Data were extracted using a standard protocol. Random-effects meta-analysis 
models were used, and I2  > 40% indicated high heterogeneity across studies. We 
used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
system to assess the quality of the evidence. Nine cohort studies comprising 
46,300 children were included. Approximately 80% (n = 7) of the studies found a 
positive association between HFI and stunting. Pooled odds ratio was 1.00 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-1.14; I2 : 76.14%). The pooled hazard ratio 
between moderate and severe HFI and stunting was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.84-1.22; I2 : 
85.96%). Due to high heterogeneity, the quality of evidence was very low. 
Individual studies showed an association between HFI and stunting in children 
aged 0-59 months; however, this association was not sustained in the pooled 
analysis, possibly because of high heterogeneity across studies.",

their empowerment could influence the nutritional status of their children. 
However, the role of maternal empowerment on the nutritional status of children 
in Ethiopia is largely unknown.
AIM: To determine the association of women's empowerment with childhood stunting 
in rural northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 582 mothers 
with children aged 6-59 months. A multistage sampling technique was used to 
select the study participants. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used 
to assess whether women's empowerment (categorized as low, moderate and high) 
and its five dimensions (household decision-making, educational status, cash 
earnings, house/land ownership, and membership in community groups) were 
associated with stunting in children. Odds ratios with 95% CI were estimated, 
and statistical significance was declared at a p-value of < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 114 (19.6%), 312 (53.6%), and 156 (26.8%) participants had 
low, moderate, and high empowerment levels, respectively. In addition, 255 
(43.8%) mothers had children who were stunted (too short for their age). In the 
adjusted models, mothers with moderate empowerment (AOR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.35, 
0.97) and high empowerment (AOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.86) had lower odds of 
having stunted children compared to mothers with low empowerment. Mothers who 
had a secondary education or higher (AOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.93), owned a 
house or land (AOR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.94) and were members of community 
groups (AOR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.80) were less likely to have stunted children.
CONCLUSION: High women empowerment was significantly associated with a lower 
likelihood of childhood stunting. The findings suggest a need to look beyond the 
direct causes of stunting and incorporate targeted strategies for empowering 
women into child nutrition programs.",

assessed the current situation in regard to several markers of maternal, 
newborn, and child health, including indicators of coverage of health 
interventions (demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods, at 
least four antenatal care visits (ANC4+), institutional birth, and three doses 
of DPT vaccine[diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus]) and health status (stunting 
in children under 5 years, neonatal and under-5 mortality rates) among the poor

population-based surveys (year range 2000-2019), contrasting the poorest 40% of 
households (referred to as poor) with the richest 60% (non-poor). Coverage in 
the most recent survey was higher for the city non-poor compared to the poor for 
all interventions in virtually all cities, with the largest median gap observed 
for ANC4+ (13.5 percentage points higher for the non-poor). Stunting, neonatal, 
and under-5 mortality rates were higher among the poor (7.6 percentage points, 
21.2 and 10.3 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively). The gaps in coverage 
between the two groups were reducing, except for ANC4, with similar median 
average annual rate of change in both groups. Similar rates of change were also 
observed for stunting and the mortality indicators. Continuation of these 
positive trends is needed to eliminate inequalities in essential health services

making healthy dietary behavior essential. Several countries face nutritional 
challenges due to a high prevalence of stunting in children under five, which 
can impact adolescent girls' eating behavior. This systematic review aims to 
provide evidence on the eating behavior of adolescent girls in such countries, 
offering insights for stunting prevention programs.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and 
registered it in PROSPERO. We employed a comprehensive search strategy across 
multiple databases. Study selection involved three stages: deduplication, 
title/abstract screening, and full-text review, with inter-reviewer agreement 
assessment.
RESULTS: The search identified 15 eligible studies from various countries, 
primarily utilizing cross-sectional designs. The studies focused on age ranges 
within adolescence and varied in sample size and assessment tools. The primary 
objective of these studies was to assess eating behavior, with outcomes related 
to dietary patterns, eating disorders, body image, and nutritional knowledge. 
The results revealed diverse eating behaviors among adolescent girls, including 
restrained eating, dieting for weight loss, craving-induced eating, and 
unhealthy dietary patterns. Many girls exhibited low dietary diversity, 
contributing to micronutrient deficiencies.
SUGGESTIONS: To address these issues effectively, stunting prevention programs 
and policies should prioritize the following strategies: implementing 
comprehensive nutritional education programs to enhance adolescents' knowledge 
of healthy eating habits and dietary diversity, providing resources and support 
for positive body image development to reduce the pressure for unhealthy 
dieting, improving access to affordable, nutrient-rich foods in both urban and 
rural areas, raising awareness about eating disorders and emphasizing early 
identification and intervention, engaging parents, caregivers, and communities 
in promoting healthy eating behaviors, and maintaining rigorous research and 
monitoring to adapt strategies based on evolving trends in adolescent eating 
behaviors.
CONCLUSION: Adolescent girls in countries with high stunting prevalence exhibit 
diverse eating behaviors that can impact their nutritional status and overall 
health. Addressing these behaviors is essential to prevent stunting and its 
long-term consequences, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive strategies 
and support for this vulnerable population.

middle-income countries. Globally, nearly 149 million under-five children are 
suffering from stunting. Despite it can occur in all age groups, the impact is 
more severe among children age less than 24 months as this period is critical 
time of very rapid growth and development. Therefore, this review aimed to 
determine the pooled prevalence and determinants of stunting among children 
during this critical period in Ethiopia.
METHODS: The literature search was conducted using international electronic data 
bases (pumed, Google scholar, CINHAL, Hinari, open Google) and the hand search 
of reference lists of eligible articles. The presence of heterogeneity between 
studies was evaluated using Cochrane Q-test and I2 test statistics and 
sensitivity analysis was also checked. Small study effect was checked through 
graphical and statistical test. Sub-group analysis was performed to handle 
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: This study included 14 studies with a total sample size of 8,056 
children. The overall pooled estimate of stunting was 35.01(95% CI: 24.73-45.28, 
I2 = 98.98%) in the country with the highest prevalence in Amhara region. 
Increased Child's age (OR = 3.83; 95% CI: 2.47-5.18, I2 = 97.76%), no maternal 
education (OR = 2.90; 95%CI: 1.59-4.20, I2 = 89.73%), no maternal postnatal 
follow up (OR = 1.81; 95% CI:1.51-2.10) less than four food diversity of the 
child (OR = 2.24;95%CI; 1.94-2.55,I2 = 21.55%), low maternal body mass index, 
failure to colostrum and exclusive breast feeding, two and more under five 
children in the household and poor wealth index of the family were significant 
factors of stunting.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The pooled prevalence of stunting among children 
during their critical time is high. Increased Child's age, no maternal education 
and no maternal postnatal follow up, less than four food diversity of the child, 
low maternal body mass index, failure to colostrum and exclusive breast feeding, 
two and more under five children in the household and poor wealth index of the 
family were determinants of stunting. Therefore, providing continuous maternal 
postnatal follow up, increase awareness of mothers on importance of colostrum 
and exclusive breast feeding, feeding of children the recommended variety of 
foods and at large to improve the wealth status of the households are crucial 
interventions to meet national and international targets of zero stunting in 
children less than 2 years.",

assess the effectiveness of locally produced ready-to-use supplementary foods in 
the prevention of stunting by detecting change in of children in intervention v. 
control arm against the 2006 WHO growth reference. A community-based 
non-randomised cluster-controlled trial was conducted from January 2018 to 
December 2020 in the district of Kurram, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. A total 
of 80 clusters (each cluster comprising ≈ 250-300 households) were defined in 
the catchment population of twelve health facilities. Children aged 6-18 months 
were recruited n 1680. The intervention included a daily ration of 50 g - 
locally produced ready-to-use-supplementary food (Wawa-Mum). The main outcome of 
this study was a change in length for age z-score (LAZ) v. WHO growth standards. 
Comparison between the interventions was by t test and ANOVA. Cox proportional 
hazard models were used to assess the association between stunting occurrence 
and the utilisation of locally produced supplement. Out of the total 1680, 
fifty-one out of the total 1680, 51·1 out of the total 1680 and 51·1 % (n 859) 
were male. Mean age 13·9 months (sd + 859) were male. Mean age 13·9 months (sd + 
-4·4). At baseline, 36·9 % (n 618) were stunted. In the intervention group, mean 
LAZ score significantly increased from -1·13(2·2 sd) at baseline to -0·93(1·8 
sd) at 6-month follow-up (P value 0·01) compared with the control group. The 
incidence rate of stunting in the intervention arm was 1·3 v. 3·4 per person 
year in the control arm. The control group had a significantly increased 
likelihood of stunting (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1·7, 95 % CI 1·46, 2·05, P value <

growth and preventing stunting. Current evidence indicates that dietary protein 
intake in children and adolescents is often two to three times higher than the 
recommendations in many regions worldwide. However, few studies have focused on 
the association between high protein intake and linear growth and stunting in 
this population. We aim to investigate this association in children and 
adolescents aged 6 to 18 years in a population with relatively high protein 
consumption.
METHODS: We conducted a large cross-sectional study involving 3299 participants 
from Shenzhen, a modern metropolis of China. Protein intake, including total 
protein, animal protein, and plant protein, was evaluated by a food-frequency 
questionnaire and expressed as grams per kilogram of body weight per day 
(g·kg-1·d-1) and as a percentage of total energy intake (%E). The primary 
outcomes were body height and height-for-age Z score (HAZ). Generalized linear 
models and logistic regression analyses were employed to examine the 
associations between protein intake and outcomes. We also conducted stratified 
analyses across different genders and pubertal stages in the aforementioned 
associations.
RESULTS: The mean protein intake was 1.81 g·kg-1·d-1 (17% E). After adjusting 
for serum calcium, zinc, vitamin D3, vitamin A levels, birth outcomes, 
lifestyle, and parental characteristics, each standard deviation increase of 1 
in protein intake (0.64 kg-1·d-1) is found to be associated with a -5.78 cm 
change in body height (95% CI: -6.12, -5.45) and a -0.79 change in HAZ (95% CI: 
-0.84, -0.74). Consistent results were observed when protein intake was 
expressed as %E or specifically as animal or plant protein. Moreover, the 
relationship between protein intake and linear growth remained consistent across 
genders in different pubertal stages, similar to that of the overall 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential hazards of high protein intake 
on linear growth in children and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when 
promoting increased protein consumption in children and adolescents who already 
have a high intake of protein.",

for children under five in rural poor households worldwide and CCT programs are 
normally used to reduce poverty through conditionalities, this study examines 
the effect of CCT program health conditionality on reducing stunting, 
considering the longer time perspective which lacks in most available evidence.
STUDY DESIGN: This was quasi-experimental design.
METHODS: The study used secondary household data kept by TASAF PSSN in Tanzania, 
coupled with corresponding children data from their respective clinic cards. The 
study used Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) for inferential statistics 
regarding household stunting.
RESULTS: Children mothers are mostly non-educated with 33 % for control and 23 % 
for treatment ended in class seven. At 95 % CI and shorter time, the control 
group were better in stunting by 0.14 points compared to treatment albeit not 
significant. For longer time, TASAF CCT program through health conditionality 
compliance reported 0.31 points reduction in stunting significant at 95 % CI.
CONCLUSION: The results reveal that for the short time, CCT health 
conditionality does not result in reducing stunting in under-five children. 
However, given the longer time (more than five years), CCT health 
conditionalities have the potential to reduce stunting in children and improve 
children's health status. The study recommends compliance with CCT program 
conditionalities as one among the means of improving under-five children's 
health status. Furthermore, the study urges policy makers to rely on longer-time

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Stunting is a common nutritional problem in children. Many risk 
factors contributing to stunting are identified in the literature. Vitamin D 
supplementation during pregnancy is useful for preventing impairment of fetal 
bone growth in the womb. However, lack of review in exploring supplementation of 
prenatal vitamin D is related to stunting in children.
PURPOSE: This study aims to identify the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D 
supplementation in preventing stunting.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, 
and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were a randomized controlled trial 
study, published between 2011-2023, a full-text article for pregnant women and 
an independent variable supplement vitamin D to prevent children's stunting. The 
keywords used in English were ""children OR child"" AND ""pregnant women"" AND 
""preventive stunting"" AND ""vitamin D"". Study quality was assessed using the 
Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tool.
RESULTS: From the results of the study selection of 511 articles, 11 articles 
met the inclusion and eligibility criteria for study analysis. Four studies 
indicated that the administration of vitamin D did not influence the length of 
the neonate's body or the Length for Age Z-Score (LAZ), used as an indicator of 
stunting. However, seven articles demonstrated that providing vitamin D 
supplements to pregnant women impacted various aspects of anthropometry, 
including the length of the neonate's body. Our findings show that the dosage 
used of vitamin D in pregnancy varied between 1400-60,000 per week. Overall, 
results of this study analysis show that the intervention of prenatal vitamin D 
supplementation has an impact on the prevention of stunting.
CONCLUSION: This literature review highlighted the benefits of maternal vitamin 
D during pregnancy and for the children's growth. Prenatal vitamin D 
supplementation is needed to prevent stunting.",

China.","Preventing stunting is particularly important for healthy development across the 
life course. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the prevalence of stunting in children 
under five years old has consistently not improved. Therefore, the primary 
objective of this study was to employ multiple machine learning algorithms to 
identify the most effective model and key predictors for stunting prediction in 
children in PNG. The study used data from the 2016-2018 Papua New Guinea 
Demographic Health Survey, including from 3380 children with complete 
height-for-age data. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
and random-forest-recursive feature elimination were used for feature selection. 
Logistic regression, a conditional decision tree, a support vector machine with 
a radial basis function kernel, and an extreme gradient boosting machine 
(XGBoost) were employed to construct the prediction model. The performance of 
the final model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and 
area under the curve (AUC). The results of the study showed that LASSO-XGBoost 
has the best performance for predicting stunting in PNG (AUC: 0.765; 95% CI: 
0.714-0.819) with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.728, 0.715, 
0.628, and 0.669, respectively. Combined with the SHAP value method, the optimal 
prediction model identified living in the Highlands Region, the age of the 
child, being in the richest family, and having a larger or smaller birth size as 
the top five important characteristics for predicting stunting. Based on the 
model, the findings support the necessity of preventing stunting early in life. 
Emphasizing the nutritional status of vulnerable maternal and child populations 
in PNG is recommended to promote maternal and child health and overall 
well-being.",

resulting in poor cognition and educational performance, low adult wages, low 
productivity, and an increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases in 
adulthood life. Accurate and reliable data on the prevalence of stunting over 
time with a sub-national estimate are scarce in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the spatiotemporal distributions and 
ecological level drivers of stunting among under-five children over time in 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A geospatial analysis using the Bayesian framework was employed to map 
the spatial variations of stunting among children aged less than five years. The 
data for the primary outcome were obtained from the Ethiopian Demographic and 
Health Surveys (2000-2019) and covariates data were accessed from different 
publicly available credible sources. The spatial binomial regression model was 
fitted to identify drivers of child stunting using the Bayesian approach.
RESULT: The national prevalence of stunting was 47.9 in 2000, 43.3 in 2005, 37.3 
in 2011, 36.6 in 2016, and 35.9 in 2019, with a total reduction rate of 25%. 
Substantial spatial clustering of stunting was observed in the Northern 
(Tigray), Northcentral (Amhara), and Northwestern (Amhara) parts of Ethiopia. 
Temperature (mean regression coefficient (β): -0.19; 95% credible interval (95% 
CrI): -0.25, -0.12) and population density (β: -0.012; 95% CrI: -0.016, -0.009) 
were negatively associated with stunting, whereas travel time to the nearest 
cities (β: 0.12; 95% CrI: 0.064, 0.17) was positively associated with child 
stunting in Ethiopia.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of stunting varied substantially at subnational and 
local levels over time. Clustering of stunted children were observed in the 
Northern parts of Ethiopia. Temperature, population density and travel time to 
the nearest cities were identified as the drivers of stunting in children.

METHODS: This study included 5-18 years old children and adolescents (n = 1,991) 
with disabilities. We used the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED), the 
Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and the Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PedsQL) to assess diet characteristics, gastrointestinal problems, 
and life quality. We collected retrospective 24-h food record to assess energy 
and nutrient intakes.
RESULTS: The rate of stunting in children with disabilities varies between 16.5% 
and 19.8%. When comparing disability types, more children with physical 
disabilities were underweight (8.8% vs. 6.7%) and stunted (19.8% vs. 16.5%), 
while more children with intellectual disabilities were tall (7.9% vs. 5.5%) and 
overweight/obese (21.1 vs. 17.2%; p < 0.05). Wasting (9.3%) and 
overweight/obesity (23.8%) were more common in children with disabilities aged 
5-7 years (p < 0.001). Eating problems such as loss of appetite, food refusal, 
food neophobia, and food selectivity were more common in children aged 
5-7 years, and problems with fast eating and overeating were more common in 
adolescents aged 13-18 years (p < 0.05). Among children and adolescents with 
disabilities, the nutrients with inadequate intakes were vitamin E, vitamin B1, 
folate, potassium, calcium, and iron, while the nutrients with intakes above the 
requirements were proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins A, B2, B6, B12, and C, 
phosphorus, zinc, and sodium. Participants with good Mediterranean diet quality 
had higher energy and nutrient intakes and higher percentages of meeting 
nutrient requirements (p < 0.05). KIDMED scores were negatively correlated with 
GSRS total (r = -0.14, p < 0.001) and subcomponent scores (abdominal pain, 
diarrhea, reflux, indigestion, and constipation; p < 0.05), and significantly 
and positively correlated with PedsQL total (r = 0.12, p < 0.001). A one-unit 
increase in the GSRS score resulted in a 14.4 times decrease in the PedsQL 
score, and a one-unit increase in the KIDMED score resulted in a 10.8 times 
increase in the PedsQL score (p = 0.001).

age, which is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 
five in developing countries. Stunting in preschool children is caused by a 
multitude of socioeconomic and child-related factors, including the employment 
status of women. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and factors 
associated with stunting of preschool children among employed and unemployed 
mothers in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia, in 2021.
METHODS: From 30 February to 30 March 2021, a community-based comparative 
cross-sectional study was conducted among 770 preschool children of employed and 
unemployed mothers in Gondar city. A structured questionnaire-based interview 
with anthropometric measurements was used to collect data. A multi-stage 
sampling technique was used. Data were entered into EPI Info version 7.22 and 
transferred to Stata version 14 for further analysis. To identify factors 
associated with stunting, a binary logistic regression analysis was used. The 
presence of an association was declared based on a p-value of <0.05 and 
confidence intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 770 preschool children participated in the study. The 
overall prevalence of stunting among preschool children was 39.7% (95% CI: 
36.3-43.2). The prevalence was higher among preschool children of employed 
mothers (42.6%) (95% CI: 37.6-47.5) than among unemployed mothers (36.7%) (95% 
CI: 32.0-41.7). Maternal age [AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.26-6.34] and wealth status 
[AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18-0.57] were significantly associated with stunting 
among unemployed mothers, while family size [AOR = 7.19, 95% CI: 2.95-17.5], 
number of children under the age of five [AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.12-3.29], and 
having a home servant [AOR = 0.126, 95% CI: 0.06-0.26] were associated with 
stunting of preschool children among employed mothers.
CONCLUSION: Stunting is more common in preschool children of employed mothers 
than in those of unemployed mothers. As a result, interventions such as raising 
awareness among employed mothers to devote time and care to their children, as 
well as concerned bodies assisting women with preschool or under-five children, 
is required. The nutrition intervention should focus on encouraging dietary 
diversity to combat the existing nutrition-associated stunting in children. 
Similarly, further research on the difference between employed and unemployed 
mothers' child stunting status as well as an investigation of extra variables 
such as the number of hours worked by an employed mother is also recommended to 
upcoming researchers.",

undernutrition and overnutrition, is a growing global concern. Families share 
resources and eating behaviors and programs often target households, yet 
evidence of the DBM at the family level is scarce.
OBJECTIVES: This study examined trends and inequality in the intrahousehold DBM 
in India between 2006 and 2021.
METHODS: Data were from 3 waves of India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS 
2006, 2016, and 2021). We examined 3 types of household member (with children 
aged <5 y) combinations: mother-child (N = 328,039 across 3 waves), 
father-child, and parent (mother and father)-child (N = 47,139 for each pair). 
The DBM was defined as one or more individuals with undernutrition (either 
wasting or stunting in children or underweight in adults) and one or more 
overweight individuals within the same household. DBM was examined over time, at 
national and subnational levels, and by residence and wealth.
RESULTS: Nearly all DBM was in the form of an overweight parent and an 
undernourished weight or stunted child. The prevalence of parent-child DBM 
increased from 15% in 2006 to 26% in 2021. Father-child pairs experienced the 
most rapid DBM increase, from 12% in 2006 to 22% in 2021, an 83% increase, 
driven by increasing overweight among men. In 2021, the DBM was highest in 
North-Eastern and Southern states, and among relatively rich households from 
urban areas. The increase in the DBM was faster in rural areas and among poor 
households compared with that in urban areas and rich households. Urban-rural 
and rich-poor inequalities in the DBM have decreased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The intrahousehold DBM has increased over time, affecting 1 in 4 
households in India in 2021. Family-based interventions that can simultaneously 
address child underweight and parent overweight are required to address India's 
increasing intrahousehold DBM.",

with stunting in children under five (AOR = 3.45, 95% CI: 1.12-4.67, p = 0.008). 
In addition, children's age (AOR = 0.250, 95% CI: 0.104-0.598, p = 0.002); 
balanced diet practices (AOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.965-2.56, p = 0.069), and 
building materials (AOR = 1.869, 95% CI: 0.87-4.00, p = 0.108 are also related 
to stunting in children under five.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve maternal nutrition need to be carried out from 
the period before pregnancy to the first 1000 days of life. Education on healthy 
home indicators, especially the use of this type of building materials for 
houses, needs to be done to improve sanitation as an effort to prevent stunting 
in children under five.",

technique was used to select the districts and study communities. A total of 94 
purposively selected vegetable producer (intervention) households and 260 
randomly selected non-producer (control) households were included in the study 
(1:3 ratio). The recumbent length of children was measured using horizontal 
wooden board to the nearest 0.1 cm. The length-for-age Z-scores were computed 
using WHO-Anthro 2006 software. Propensity score-matching and 
difference-in-difference (DID) estimates were used to analyze data using STATA 
software version 12. Prevalence of child stunting was 19.8 (12.7-29.4) and 21.1 
(16.4-26.7)% (baseline) and 43.5 (33.5-54.1) and 46.5 (45.7-47.2)% (end line) 
among intervention and control groups, respectively. Child stunting was higher 
for boys and older children from both intervention and control households. DID 
estimation revealed that there was no significant difference in child stunting 
between intervention and control households (DID = 1.7, p = .604). However, 
there was an intervention effect of -0.5, 2.5, and 1.7% in the prevalence of 
child stunting among females, males, and both sexes, respectively. Vegetable 
production as an intervention strategy reduced the prevalence of stunting in 
children aged 6-23 months. However, vegetable production needs to be well 
integrated with other nutrition-sensitive interventions to realize the objective 
of reducing child stunting.",

complication. It leads to consequences including infant mortality, low birth 
weight, preterm birth, unrecoverable or partially reversible neurobehavioral and 
cognitive deficits, and short birth length. However, the relationship between 
maternal anemia and stunting in children is not well defined. This systematic 
literature review sought to determine whether maternal anemia was associated 
with height or length and stunting conditions in infants and children ages 0-60 
mo in cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies carried out in several 
countries.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed on articles published from 2014-2021 
related to maternal anemia and stunting. The electronic databases used were 
ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Search, and AJOG (American 
Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology). The literature search was performed up to 
December 7, 2021.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. Nine studies examined the correlation 
between maternal anemia and length or weight in children. Seven of the nine 
studies showed an association between maternal anemia and stunting in children; 
the others showed an association between maternal anemia and birth length. Three 
studies found no association between maternal anemia and stunting in children 
under age 5 y.
CONCLUSIONS: The current review emphasizes that stunting in children may be 
associated with maternal anemia, specifically in developing countries. This 
implies that it is crucial to prevent anemia in adolescent girls and women 
before and during pregnancy as a part of programs to eliminate stunting in 
children.",

particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Indonesia. Intervention 
efforts often come too late as many of the underlying causal factors have 
already occurred earlier. While antenatal multiple micronutrient supplements 
(MMS) have demonstrated positive effects on pregnancy outcomes, their impact on 
infant growth in the first six months remains inadequately explored in 
epidemiological studies. This study aims to identify factors associated with 
stunting at six months in infants whose mothers received MMS. A population-based 
cohort study was conducted in four subdistricts of Banggai, Indonesia. Pregnant 
women were recruited in their third trimester and followed up until their 
children were six months of age. Validated questionnaires were employed to 
gather data on social determinants of health and diet, and standardised methods 
were utilised for anthropometric measurements. Stunting was determined based on 
the WHO child growth standards. The analysis comprised data from 152 
mother-child pairs. The prevalence of stunting during early infancy (first two 
months) was 18.4%, which decreased to 15.8% in later infancy (at six months). 
Factors such as small-for-gestational-age (AOR = 11.29; 2.73-46.66), preterm 
birth (AOR = 6.33; 1.25-31.97), short birth length (AOR = 4.31; 1.11-16.78), 
maternal mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) below 23.5 cm, and female infants 
(AOR = 3.27; 95%CI: 1.04-10.27) were associated with stunting at six months. 
This study highlights that stunting in the first six months is present at birth, 
with small-for-gestational-age (SGA) as a strong predictor. In addition, there 
was a trend to improved growth (-0.30 [-0.79 to 0.18]) in infants born to 
mothers who received MMS supplementation pre-pregnancy rather than during 
pregnancy, although it was not statistically significant.",

child-related, and structural variables that influence stunting. In total, 56.9% 
of children under age five were stunted, of those 31.0% moderately and 25.9% 
severely. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that older children, male 
children (adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.41, 95% CI 1.24-1.61), and children who were 
perceived as small (aOR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.55-2.59) or very small at birth

malnutrition and the very high prevalence of smoking in Indonesia, few studies 
have examined the effects of parental smoking on children's nutritional status. 
This study aims to measure the relationship between family smoking behavior and 
the occurrence of stunting in children under 5 years. This cross-sectional study 
used a purposive sampling technique, with 221 households with children aged 0 to 
59 months from poor areas in Indonesia. Exposure to cigarette smoke is assessed 
using The Secondhand Smoke Exposure Scale questionnaire. The outcome measured is 
child stunting (height-for-age Z-score). The prevalence of stunting was 
estimated at 145 (65.6%). Children living with smoking parents were counted for 
157 (71%), and most smoking exposure comes from fathers 147 (67.4%). The 
predictors of stunting in children under 5 years were a smoker father with (AOR

approach that effectively induces robust immunogenicity directed to 
serotype-specific lipopolysaccharide and the broadly conserved IpaB and IpaC

health concern that cause severe diarrhea and dysentery in children and 
travelers to endemic areas of the world. Despite significant advancements in 
access to clean water, the increases in antimicrobial resistance and the risk of 
post-infection sequelae, including cognitive and physical stunting in children, 
highlight the urgent need for an efficacious vaccine. One promising vaccine 
approach, artificial Invaplex, delivers key antigens recognized by the immune 
system during infection, which results in increased resistance to re-infection.

Therefore, the first 1000 days of life between a woman's pregnancy and her 
child's 2nd birthday offer a unique window of opportunity to build healthier and 
more prosperous futures. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of 
nutritional supplementation during the first 1000-days to reduce the prevalence 
of stunting in children at 24 months of age.
METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, we enrolled women during 
their pregnancy from two rural districts of Sindh, Pakistan. A cluster was one 
union council with a population of ∼25000 residents. Out of 29 clusters, we 
randomly allocated 6 clusters to the intervention and control groups each. 
Pregnant women received a monthly supply of 5 kg (i.e., 165 grams/day) of wheat 
soya blend plus (WSB+) during pregnancy and the first six months of their 
lactation period. In addition, their children received lipid-based nutrient 
supplement - medium-quantity (LNS-MQ) between 6-23 months of age. The primary 
outcome was a reduction in the prevalence of stunting in children at 24 months 
of age. Analysis was an intention to treat. The trial is registered on 
ClinicalTrial.gov, number NCT02422953.
FINDINGS: Two thousand thirty pregnant women (1017 in the intervention group and 
1013 in the control group) were enrolled between August 30, 2014, and May 25, 
2016. Monthly follow-ups were conducted between October 1, 2014, and October 25, 
2018. At 24 months of age, we captured data from 699 (78%) of 892 live births in 
the intervention group and 653 (76%) of 853 live births in the control group. 
There was a significant difference in mean length (49.4 cm vs 48.9 cm, p 
=0.027), weight (3.1 kg vs 3.0 kg, p =0.013), length for age z-scores (-1.2 vs 
-1.5, p =0.004) and weight for age z-scores (-1.2 vs -1.5, p =0.015) among 
infants in the intervention compared to control group. At 24 months of age, a 
significant difference in the prevalence of stunting (absolute difference, 
10.2%, 95% CI 18.2 to 2.3, p =0.017) and underweight (absolute difference, 
13.7%, 95% CI 20.3 to 7.0, p =0.001) were observed in the intervention as 
compared to the control group. The prevalence of wasting was not significantly 
different between the intervention and control groups (absolute difference, 
6.9%, 95% CI 14.1 to 0.3, p =0.057).
INTERPRETATION: Provision of WSB+ and LNS-MQ during the first 1000-days of life 
improved child linear growth and reduced stunting in children at 24 months. This 
study can be scaled-up in similar settings to lower the prevalence of stunting 
in children under two years of age.

in poor households (APR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3; p-value = 0.021), children under 
five who lived in a household with three or more children under five (APR:1.8; 
95% CI: 1.2-2.7; p-value = 0.002), children aged 12-23 months (APR: 1.8; 95% CI: 
1.2-2.6; p-value = 0.006), children aged 24-59 months (APR: 1.9; 95% CI: 
1.3-2.7; p-value = 0.001). On the 2018 survey, the determinants were maternal 
BMI (APR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; p-value = 0.004), maternal weight (APR: 0.9; 
95% CI: 0.95-0.98; p-value = <0.001), mothers with no education or with 
education in primary school (APR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3-2.7; p-value = 0.001), 
mothers with education in middle school (APR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3-2.7; p-value = 
0.001), mothers with education in high school (APR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.6; 
p-value = 0.004), children aged 12-23 months (APR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4-3.0; p-value 
= <0.001), children aged 24-59 months (APR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.9-3.6; p-value = 
<0.001), male (APR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.01-1.4; p-value = 0.035), and acute 
respiratory infection (ARI) (APR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.04-2.5; p-value = 0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of stunting in children under five in South 
Sulawesi Province are number of children under five in the household, maternal 
education, maternal weight, maternal height, maternal BMI, child's age, and 
birthweight. Meanwhile, the determinants of stunting in children under five in 
West Sulawesi were wealth, maternal education, maternal weight, maternal BMI,, 
child's age, child's sex, and history of acute respiratory infection. Hence, 
intervention on household and child levels as well as maternal sociodemographic 
factors need to be addressed.",

assess the scientific evidence of the relationship between vulnerability to 
access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices on 
stunting in children aged <5 years in developing countries.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis article to assess 
the relationship between under-five stunting and WASH vulnerability in 
developing countries.
METHODS: The systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
protocol methodology. The following databases were used: LILACS, MEDLINE (via 
PubMed), SciELO, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, and Embase. All original 
studies identified that related WASH vulnerability to stunting in children aged 
<5 years in developing countries was included. Three authors performed 
independently the selection and extraction of data from the articles. The 
statistical software STATA version 11 was used. Cochran's Q test and Chi-square 
test (I2) with 95% significance were used to assess the heterogeneity of the 
studies.
RESULTS: The search resulted in the initial identification of 2047 articles; 
after reading the abstracts, followed by the full articles, 14 articles were 
included in the systematic review and eight articles were included in the 
meta-analysis. The studies selected for the systematic review were published 
between the years 1992 and 2021 and conducted in eight countries, namely, 
Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Peru, China, and Lesotho. The 
studies assessed vulnerability to access to WASH on the growth of children aged 
<5 years. There was a significant difference when relating WASH vulnerability to 
children's height. The meta-analysis of this study showed that the impact of 
WASH on child stunting is significant when it comes to lack of sanitation in 72% 
of the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that WASH vulnerability contributes to stunting in 
children aged <5 years in developing countries. Based on our findings, we 
recommend incorporating WASH strategies, especially sanitation, into the 
formulation of interventions integrating with health promotion policies for 
healthy early childhood development.",

a normal, healthy upbringing. Having similar risk factors and serious 
consequences, the syndemic aspect of these two ailments is mostly underrated, 
and positive deviant (PD) factors that ensure non-anemic status in stunted 
children have not been studied to date.
METHODS: This study aimed to identify PD factors that have potential to prevent 
syndemic anemia among stunted children aged 6-59 months in Myanmar. This was a 
cross-sectional secondary analysis of the Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS) data conducted in 2016, applying the PD concept, where children who were 
stunted without anemia were considered as PDs.
RESULTS: Among 1248 stunted children, those who had the syndemic condition were 
compared with their PD peers in terms of maternal characteristics as well as 
socioeconomic and health-related factors. Multivariable logistic regression 
analyses were used to identify the determinants of syndemic state. The results 
showed that three out of every five stunted children were anemic. The syndemic 
risk was decreased among children of maternal age groups 20-34 years and 35-44 
years: [aOR] = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05-0.69; p = 0.012, and aOR = 0.19, 95% 
CI = 0.05-0.75; p = 0.018, respectively. Moderately stunted children (aOR = 
0.53, 95% CI = 0.34-0.81; p = 0.004) and children who were not currently 
breastfed (aOR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.01-2.41; p = 0.044) were less likely to 
develop the syndemic condition.
CONCLUSION: Maternal age, stunting severity, breastfeeding duration, and 
maternal anemic status are strong predictors in determining hemoglobin 
concentrations among stunted children. This study suggests that nutritional 
interventions targeting PD factors could represent syndemic action in improving 
child health.",

development and influencing cognitive capacity of children. This study aimed to 
examine the trends and determinants of stunting from infancy to middle 
adolescence in four countries: Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam.
METHODS: A 15-year longitudinal data on the trends of stunting were obtained 
from the Young Lives cohort study. The study includes 38,361 observations from 4 
countries. A generalized mixed-effects model was adopted to estimate the 
determinant of stunting.
RESULTS: The patterns of stunting in children from aged 1 to 15 years have 
declined from an estimated 30% in 2002 to 20% in 2016. Stunting prevalence 
varied among four low- and middle-income countries with children in Ethiopia, 
India, and Peru being more stunted compared to children in Vietnam. The highest 
stunted was recorded in India and the lowest was recorded in Vietnam. In all 
four countries, the highest prevalence of severe stunting was observed in 2002 
and moderate stunting was observed in 2006. Parents' education level played a 
significance role in determining a child stunting. Children of uneducated 
parents were shown to be at a higher risk of stunting.
CONCLUSION: Disparities of stunting were observed between- and within-country of 
four low- and middle-income with the highest prevalence recorded in low-income 
country. Child stunting is caused by factors related to child's age, household 
wealth, household size, the mother's and father's education level, residence 
area and access to save drinking water.",

disproportionately impacts underserved communities. The Vaccine Impact on 
Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Study examined the association between an episode of 
moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and the risk of subsequent stunting in 
children <5 years living in 3 sub-Saharan African countries.
METHODS: In this prospective, matched, case-control study among children <5 
years, data were collected over 36 months from 2 groups. ""Children with MSD"" 
visited a health center within 7 days of illness onset experiencing ≥3 loose 
stools/day plus sunken eyes, poor skin turgor, dysentery, intravenous 
rehydration, or hospitalization. ""Children without MSD"" were enrolled from the 
community within 14 days of the index MSD child; they were diarrhea-free during 
the previous 7 days and were matched to the index case by age, sex, and 
residence. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we estimated the 
effect of an MSD episode on odds of being stunted, defined as height-for-age 
z-scores <-2, at a follow-up visit 2-3 months post-enrollment.
RESULTS: The proportion of stunting at enrollment was similar when 4603 children 
with MSD and 5976 children without MSD were compared (21.8% vs 21.3%; P = .504). 
Among children not stunted at enrollment, those with MSD had 30% higher odds of 
being stunted at follow-up than children without MSD after controlling for age, 
sex, study site, and socioeconomic status (adjusted OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.05-1.62: 
P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: Children <5 years in sub-Saharan Africa without stunting 
experienced an increased likelihood of stunting during 2-3 months following an 
episode of MSD. Strategies for control of early childhood diarrhea should be 
integrated into programs intended to reduce childhood stunting.",

the economic growth of Bangladesh, accounting for 10% of the country's GDP and 
more than 80% of its foreign exchange earnings. The workforce in this sector is 
predominantly made up of women, with 2.5 million women working in the industry. 
However, these women face numerous challenges in carrying out their 
culturally-expected household responsibilities, including childcare, due to 
severe resource constraints. As a result, the children of these working women 
have a higher incidence of malnutrition, particularly stunted growth. This study 
aims to identify the factors that contribute to stunting in children under the 
age of five whose mothers work in the RMG sector in Bangladesh.
METHODS: The study collected data from 267 female RMG workers in the Gazipur 
district of Bangladesh using a simple random sampling technique. Chi-square 
tests were used to determine the associations between the factors influencing 
child stunting, and Multinomial Logit Models were used to estimate the 
prevalence of these factors.
RESULTS: The study found that the prevalence of moderate and severe stunting 
among the children of RMG workers living in the Gazipur RMG hub was 19% and 20%, 
respectively. The study identified several significant predictors of child 
stunting, including the mother's education level, nutritional knowledge, control 
over resources, receipt of antenatal care, household size, sanitation 
facilities, and childbirth weight. The study found that improving the mother's 
education level, increasing household size, and receiving antenatal care during 
pregnancy were important factors in reducing the likelihood of child stunting. 
For example, if a mother's education level increased from no education to 
primary or secondary level, the child would be 0.211 (0.071-0.627) and 0.384 
(0.138-1.065) times more likely to have a normal weight and height, 
respectively, than to be moderately stunted.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the challenges faced by working women in the 
RMG sector, who often receive minimal wages and have limited access to antenatal 
care services. To address these challenges, the study recommends policies that 
support antenatal care for working-class mothers, provide daycare facilities for 
their children, and implement a comprehensive social safety net program that 
targets child nutrition. Improving the socioeconomic status of mothers is also 
critical to reducing child malnutrition in this population.",

pregnancy and lactation, as well as infant health and nutrition. Women are 
vulnerable to poor nutrition given their increased nutrient requirements during 
the prenatal period through the first 2 years postpartum. Minimum diet diversity 
among women, a good predictor of adequate micronutrient intake, is often used as 
a proxy for diet quality. The Kyrgyz Republic is experiencing a triple burden of 
malnutrition-stunting in children, overweight and obesity in women, and 
micronutrient deficiencies and anemia in both women and children. In this study, 
we assessed factors associated with the quality of maternal diets in winter when 
micronutrient-rich foods may be more difficult to access due to scarcity and 
price. We conducted secondary data analysis from a survey conducted in the 
winter of 1,359 mothers of children aged younger than 2 years. Women were asked 
about the types of foods they stored and preserved in the fall and whether any 
remained in winter. After controlling for maternal characteristics, household 
size, main source of income, and region (including urban and rural), women with 
preserved food remaining at the time of the survey, who stored more than 4 
different types of food in the fall, and who lived in Jalal-Abad oblast were 
more likely to have consumed a minimally diverse diet. Where seasonality affects 
food availability, promoting culturally appropriate home processing of a variety 
of foods in the fall and increased market access may improve diet diversity in 
winter.",

(DRC) is one of the highest globally. However, only a few studies have attempted 
to measure the association between stunting and vegetation, which is an 
important food source. The leaf area index (LAI) is an excellent measure for the 
vegetation state.
OBJECTIVE: This paper intended to measure the association between the LAI and 
stunting among children under five years of age in the DRC. Its aim was to 
better understand the boundary conditions of stunting and explore potential 
links to climate and environmental change.
METHODS: This paper adopts a secondary data analysis approach. We used data on 
5241 children from the DRC Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2013-2014, which was 
collected from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. We used the 
satellite-derived LAI as a measure for the state of vegetation and created a 
10-km buffer to extract each DHS cluster centroid's corresponding mean leaf-area 
value. We used a generalised mixed-effect logistic regression to measure the 
association between LAI and stunting, adjusting the model for mother's 
education, occupation and birth interval, as well as child's age and national 
wealth quintile. A height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) was calculated and classified 
according to WHO guidelines.
RESULTS: Children in communities surrounded by high LAI values have lower odds 
of being stunted (OR [odds ratio] = 0.63; 95% CI [confidence 
interval] = 0.47-0.86) than those exposed to low LAI values. The association 
still holds when the exposure is analysed as a continuous variable (OR = 0.84; 
95% CI = 0.74-0.95).When stratified in rural and urban areas, a significant 
association was only observed in rural areas (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.39-0.81), but 
not in urban areas (OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.5-0.5). Furthermore, the study showed 
that these associations were robust to LAI buffer variations under 25 km.
CONCLUSIONS: Good vegetation conditions have a protective effect against 
stunting in children under five years of age. Further advanced study designs are 
needed to confirm these findings.",

countries. Aceh, a westernmost province in Indonesia recorded the highest 
prevalence of stunting in children under two years old in the nation. Our study 
investigated the current government efforts on child stunting reduction 
activities since the introduction of Governor Regulation No. 14/2019.
METHODS: The study investigated the current efforts of Aceh governments and 
relevant actors on child stunting reduction using in-depth interviews, document 
reviews and focus group discussions.
RESULTS: Thirty-five (35) respondents including policy makers were interviewed, 
four focus group discussions (15 each group) were conducted, and various 
official documents were reviewed. Various challenges for reducing child stunting 
in Aceh were identified: inadequate knowledge and skills of Posyandu cadres on 
child stunting; reluctance to consume iron and folic acid (IFA), and 
supplementary foods (PMT Bumil) by many pregnant women due to perceived annoying 
effects and unappetizing taste; work engagement, insufficient breast milk 
production and inadequate support from husbands failing to achieve exclusive 
breastfeeding among nursing women; inadequate provision of complementary 
fortified foods for children 6-23 months; lack of clean water, waste management 
and WASH practices.
CONCLUSION: The intervention on both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive 
factors was found to be insufficient in Aceh. Although WASH (water, sanitation 
and hygiene) practices are the most important contributors to child stunting, 
only the health agency plays a singular role in reduction efforts by focussing 
on specific factors. Coordination between relevant agencies to address both 
factors is required to achieve the effectiveness of child stunting reduction and 
prevention in Aceh.",

first step in creating effective interventions is identifying the risk factors 
for stunting. This study aims to pinpoint the stunting risk factors in East Nusa 
Tenggara Province, Indonesia, by incorporating secondary data from the 2018 
Indonesia Basic Health Research (RISKESDAS). This study implemented a 
cross-sectional design by utilizing the data of individuals who were 
successfully visited during the survey. Initial data screening in East Nusa 
Tenggara Province based on the criteria for children aged 0−59 months and 
stunting showed as many as 1643. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
performed to evaluate the relationship between children’s characteristics and 
stunting. There was a significant relationship between age group variables for 
younger children (aged 12−23, 24−35, and 36−47 months), mothers with low 
education, and children living in rural areas with the incidence of stunting in 
children (p-value < 0.05). The dominant factors that caused stunting in this 
study were the children’s age of 24−35 months (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.12−3.86), 
mothers with low education (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.18−2.08), and children living 
in rural areas (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.01−1.91). The highest prevalence of 
stunting was in the group of children aged 12−23 months (45.2%). To prevent 
child stunting, the government must intervene for mothers with low education and 
those living in rural areas. Intervention includes intensive socialization about 
improving nutritional status during pregnancy and practicing complementary 
feeding and breastfeeding habits until the child is 24 months old.",

development, diabetes, degenerative and CVD later in life. Numerous modifiable 
factors decrease the risk of stunting in children. This study aimed to assess 
the role of the individual, household and social factors on stunting in 
Zimbabwean children.
DESIGN: A 1:2 unmatched case-control study.
SETTING: This study was conducted in two predominantly rural provinces (one with 
the highest national prevalence of stunting and one with the lowest prevalence) 
in Zimbabwe.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the caregivers of 150 children aged 
between 6 and 59 months with stunting and from the caregivers of 300 children 
without stunting.
RESULTS: Multiple (39) correlates of stunting were identified. Child's age, 
birth length, birth weight, and weight-for-age outcome (child-related factors), 
caregiver's age, maternal HIV status, occupation, and education (parental 
factors), breast-feeding status, number of meals, and dietary quality (dietary 
factors), child's appetite, diarrhoeal and worm infection (childhood illnesses), 
income status, access to safe water, access to a toilet, health clubs and 
maternal support in infant feeding (household, socio-cultural factors) were all 
found to be significant predictors of childhood stunting.
CONCLUSION: Nearly all aspects under review from the individual-, household- to 
social-level factors were significantly associated with childhood stunting. 
These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting the WHO stunting 
framework and strengthen the need to focus interventions on a multi-sectoral 
approach to effectively address stunting in high prevalence countries.",

Growth Length Mat (Stunting Mat) was designed to stunting directly. However, the 
Mat has not been validated for use in Ghana. This study compared stunting 
measured with the Mat and stunting measured following the WHO recommended 
procedure. We sampled 163 children aged 6-24 months in the Bono region of Ghana. 
We also explored the acceptability and interpretability of the two procedures 
among mothers and healthcare givers.
RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting was 3.7% and 11.7% using the Mat and WHO 
procedures respectively. The Growth Length Mat had very low sensitivity (21.0%) 
but high specificity (98.6%) of detecting stunting in children. However, in 
younger aged children, the Mat was more accurate in detecting stunting. Both 
healthcare workers and caregivers found it easy to interpret the stunting status 
of children using the Mat. We conclude that the Growth Length Mat was less 
sensitive at detecting child stunting compared to the current gold standard of 
measuring stunting in younger children. There are possibilities to improve the 
accuracy and utility of the Mat for measuring stunting in low-resource settings 
by re-designing the mat to be more age appropriate.",

outcome variable was undernutrition; specifically, wasting (low 
weight-for-height) and stunting (low height-for-age) in children.Data analysis 
Evidence was grouped into caries of the permanent dentition, primary dentition, 
early childhood caries and severe early childhood caries as a risk factor for 
undernutrition. A best-available-evidence approach was applied to narrative 
synthesis. Evidence synthesis by vote counting was depicted using harvest plots. 
The heterogeneous nature of the data prevented a meta-analysis from being 
appropriate.Results Of the 2,690 studies identified, 117 underwent quality 
assessment, resulting in 46 studies for narrative synthesis and 38 pertaining to 
wasting or stunting included in vote counting. The majority of studies were 
cross-sectional (33 studies).For the permanent dentition, the balance of 
evidence showed generally no association between caries prevalence or severity 
with wasting. For the primary dentition, positive associations between dental 
caries prevalence and severity with wasting, as well as between dental caries 
prevalence and severity with stunting, were reported. Conclusions Overall, the 
authors concluded that the balance of evidence favoured an association between 
dental caries in the primary dentition and undernutrition in children but 
highlighted the complexity of synthesising dental and nutritional data along 
with dentition type, age of child participants and income status of countries.",

risk factors. Analytical cross-section study was carried out in Musanze, a 
district of Rwanda and involved 241 mothers having children aged between 6 and

The MAD had a significant (p = 0.021) association with height-for-age Z-score of 
a child and was found to be the stunting's predictor. The child's sex, 
consumption of animal sourced foods, child underweight status and income type 
were revealed as other stunting risk factors. A holistic approach that promotes 
infant and young child feeding practices and complementary feeding in particular 
can contribute to the alleviation of the stunting burden in Rwanda. Further, 
other associated factors that influence child nutrition status should be taken

stunting with sanitation, enteric infections, and EED among children aged 
24-59 months in rural northwest Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional 
study was conducted among 224 randomly selected children aged 24-59 months in 
rural areas of the east Dembiya district. We collected information on household 
food insecurity and dietary diversity using pre-tested questionnaires adopted 
from the food and nutrition technical assistance (FANTA) project. We used 
height-for-age-z score (HAZ) to define stunting. We also used the data collected 
to measure the environmental exposures of children to intestinal parasitic 
infections and fecal biomarkers of EED. A multivariable binary logistic 
regression model was used to assess the association of stunting with sanitation, 
enteric infections, and EED. Of the 224 children, 33% (95% CI 27, 39%) were 
stunted. Stunting in children was significantly associated with poor dietary 
intake (AOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2, 7.3), open defecation practice (AOR 3.0, 95% CI 
1.2, 7.9), presence of animal excreta in the living environment (AOR 3.4, 95% CI

2.9, 95% CI 1.2, 6.7). One-third of the children in the study area were stunted 
and this high prevalence of stunting was associated with poor dietary intake, 
poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, enteric infections, and EED. Thus, 
stunting can be prevented by improving sanitation and hygienic conditions to 
prevent repeated enteric infections in children and by promoting dietary

associated factors among children aged less than 5 years in Ethiopia using 
Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data from 2005 to 2019.
DESIGN: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted.
SETTING: The study was conducted in Ethiopia.
PARTICIPANTS: In 2005, 4586 individuals were examined, followed by 10 282 in 
2011, 9462 in 2016 and 4937 in 2019.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of the study was stunting, 
and the secondary outcome was factors associated with stunting and its change. A 
multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify individual and 
community-level factors associated with stunting among children aged less than 5 
years. Multivariate decomposition analysis was also carried out to assess the 
role of compositional characteristics and behavioural change for decline in 
stunting among children aged less than 5 years in Ethiopia.
RESULTS: Over the study period, the prevalence rate of stunting in children aged 
less than 5 years decreased from 47% to 37% in 2019. Differences in behavioural 
change among children under the age of 5 years account for 76.69% of the overall 
decline in stunting prevalence rate in the years 2005-2011, 86.53% in the years 
2005-2016, 98.9% in the years 2005-2019, 70.34% in the years 2011-2016 and 
73.77% in the years 2011-2019. Behavioural adjustments among breastfed children, 
diet diversity, place of delivery, ANC follow-up and region have all had a major 
effect on stunting prevalence rate. The wealth index, parenteral education, 
child's age in months, length of breast feeding and area were among the 
compositional change factors.
CONCLUSION: A large percentage of children aged less than 5 years remains 
stunted in Ethiopia. Stunting was associated with alterations in the 
compositional and behavioural characteristics of children. Stimulating existing 
nutritional measures and improving the wealth index will make a significant 
difference in reducing stunting among Ethiopian children aged less than 5 years.",

were enroled in a nationally representative prospective cohort within the 
National Evaluation of Malawi's Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission 
Programme after Option B+ implementation (2014-2018). Anthropometry was measured 
at enrolment (age 1-6 months), visit 1 (approximately 12 months), and visit 2 
(approximately 24 months). Weight-for-age (WAZ) and length-for-age (LAZ) 
z-scores were calculated using World Health Organization Growth Standards; 
underweight and stunting were defined as WAZ and LAZ more than 2 standard 
deviations below the reference median. Multivariable logistic regression 
restricted to CHEU aged 24 months (±3 months) was used to identify factors 
associated with stunting. Among 1211 CHEU, 562/1211 attended visit 2, of which 
529 were aged 24 months (±3 months) and were included. At age 24 months, 40.4% 
of CHEU were stunted and/or underweight, respectively. In multi-variable 
analysis, adjusting for child age and sex, the odds of stunting were higher 
among CHEU with infectious disease diagnosis compared to those with no diagnosis 
(adjusted odds ratio = 3.35 [95% confidence interval: 1.82-6.17]), which was 
modified by co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (p = 0.028). Infant low birthweight was 
associated with an increased odds of stunting; optimal feeding and maternal 
employment were correlated with reduced odds. This is one of the first studies 
examining CHEU growth since Option B+. Interventions to improve linear growth 
among CHEU should address their multi-faceted health risks, alongside maternal 
ART prescription, and follow-up of mother-child pairs.",

when using the weight-for-height indicator. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the diagnostic concordance of the anthropometric indicators of wasting 
and the relationship between wasting and stunting in children from highly 
vulnerable communities in Guatemala. (2) Methods: The sample consisted of 13,031 
anthropometric records of children under five years of age (49.5% girls, average 
age of 27.9 months), including weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference 
(MUAC), collected in March-August 2019. The proportions of stunting, 
underweight, and wasting, assessed by three different indicators, as well as 
their concurrence through the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure were 
calculated. (3) Results: Stunting affected 73% of the sample, and 74.2% showed 
anthropometric failure. Wasting varied by indicator (weight-for-height: 2.8%; 
MUAC: 4.4%; MUAC-for-age: 10.6%). Concordance between MUAC and weight-for-height 
was very low (Kappa: 0.310; sensitivity: 40.9%). MUAC identified more wasted 
children in the stunted group (53.6% vs. 26.5%), while the opposite occurred in

stunting. The aim of this study was to provide smoothed HAZ growth reference 
values and their curves for Pakistani children and adolescents aged 2-18 years. 
The prevalence of stunting in Pakistani children was determined. A total of 
10,668 healthy Pakistani participants were included. Information related to age, 
sex, city of residence and height (cm) was used. Age- and sex-specific smoothed 
HAZ growth reference values and associated graphs were obtained using the 
lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method. The prevalence of stunting was calculated by 
applying WHO 2007 and USCDC 2000 height-for-age references and local reference 
of the study population. In both sexes, the smoothed HAZ curves increased with 
age. For 2 and 3 years of age, the height values of the girls were greater than 
those of the boys. The boys were then taller than the girls. Comparing our 
median height (z = 0) growth reference data from WHO, USCDC and corresponding 
data from other countries, Pakistani children and adolescents have significantly 
different reference values than their counterparts in the reference group. A 
marked overestimation of the prevalence of stunting was observed (10.8% and 
17.9% according to WHO and USCDC, respectively) compared to the local reference 
(3.0%). It is recommended that the prevalence of stunting in children and 
adolescents is determined by applying local height growth references to plan 
health strategies and treatments in the local population.",

including Tanzania; hence, contributing to about half of the deaths among young 
children. Objective: The current study aimed at identifying child feeding 
practices and determinants of stunting in children under the age of five years 
in Mvomero District. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 150 mother-child 
pairs was carried out in Turiani ward, Mvomero district in Morogoro region. 
Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify 
factors associated with stunting. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered sta-tistically 
significant. Five focus group discussions comprising 5-9 mothers with children 
below five years participated in the study. Thematic analysis was used to 
analyse data from the in-depth interviews. Results: The prevalence of 
underweight, stunting and wasting in Mvomero district was 16.8, 42.2, and 6.2% 
respectively. Pre-lacteal feeding was common in the study area (40%). Children 
were introduced to complementary food too early (˂6 months) with plain maize 
porridge being the first food introduced. About 57.2% of children were on the 
lowest tercile (≤3 food groups per day) dietary diversity score. Significant 
determinants of stunting were the family source of income (AOR 1.63, 95% CI: 
1.99-2.3), age of a child (AOR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.03-3.50) and family size (AOR 
3.22, 95% CI: 1.61-4.27). Other factors were consumption of animal foods (AOR 
5.30, 95% CI: 0.26-0.60) and dietary diversity score (AOR 1.615, 95% CI: 
1.014-2.574). Conclusion: Child feeding practices in the study area are 
sub-optimal. These findings have important implications for interventions to 
address stunting among children.",

live in the same household as overweight or obese adults (the so-called double 
burden of malnutrition), evidence that quality as well as quantity of food is 
important. In recent years, food security measurement has shifted away from 
anthropometry (e.g., stunting) to experiential measures (e.g., self-reported 
hunger). However, given the continued problem of stunting, it is important that 
national surveys identify malnutrition.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between a variety of food security 
indicators, including dietary diversity, with adult, child (0-4 years) (5-9 
years) and adolescent (10-17 years) anthropometry. To estimate the prevalence of 
double burden households.
METHODS: The study utilized cross-sectional data from the South African National 
Income Dynamics Survey NIDS (2008). We examined the associations between five 
food security indicators and anthropometry outcomes. The indicators were adult 
and child hunger in the household, self-reported household food sufficiency, 
food expenditure>60% of monthly expenditure and household dietary diversity. 
Multinomial and logistic regression models were employed to examine the 
associations with adult BMI categories and children's stunting and BMI.
RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting was 18.4% and the prevalence of wasting and 
overweight was 6.8 and 10.4%, respectively. Children <5 and adolescents with 
medium dietary diversity were significantly more likely to be stunted than 
children with high dietary diversity. Among children <5, child hunger and medium 
dietary diversity were significantly associated with wasting. None of the food 
security indicators were associated with stunting in children aged 5-9. Among 
stunted children, 70.2% lived with an overweight or obese adult. Among adults, 
increased dietary diversity increased the risk of overweight and obesity.
CONCLUSION: Dietary diversity can be used as a proxy for poor nutritional status 
among children <5 years and adolescents but the relationship between dietary 
diversity and adult obesity is more complex. Given the double burden of 
malnutrition in many low- and middle-income countries, indicators of dietary 
quality remain important. These tools can be further refined to include an extra 
category for processed foods. Given the relative simplicity to collect this 
data, national surveys would be improved by its inclusion.",

categorised children into younger (6-23 months) and older (24-59 months) age 
groups. Age and sex variations in near-term (within 6 months) mortality risk, 
associated with individual anthropometric deficits were assessed in a secondary 
analysis of multi-country cohort data. A random effects meta-analysis was 
performed. Data from seven low-or-middle-income-countries collected between 1977 
and 2013 were analysed. One thousand twenty deaths were recorded for children 
with anthropometric deficits. Pooled meta-analysis estimates showed no 
differences by age in absolute mortality risk for wasting (RR 1.08, p = 0.826 
for MUAC < 125 mm; RR 1.35, p = 0.272 for WHZ < -2). For underweight and 
stunting, absolute risk of death was higher in younger (RR 2.57, p < 0.001) 
compared with older children (RR 2.83, p < 0.001). For all deficits, there were 
no differences in mortality risk for girls compared with boys. There were no 
differences in the risk of mortality between younger and older wasted children, 
supporting continued inclusion of all children under-five in wasting treatment 
programmes. The risk of mortality associated with underweight and stunting was 
higher among younger children, suggesting that prevention programmes might be 
justified in focusing on younger children where resources are limited. There 
were no sex differences by age in mortality risk for all deficits.",

have a length or height that is less than -2 standard deviations of the growth 
standard of Indonesian children. Stunting is caused by chronic malnutrition in 
the first 1000 days of life. The spatial panel data method was developed to 
solve problems related to spatial objects that are measured periodically by 
involving elements of area and time.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the best model and 
factors that influence stunting in children under 5 years of age in Indonesia 
using spatial panel data.
METHODS: The data used were from the website of the Central Statistics Agency 
and the publications of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia in 
2015-2019. Determination of the selected model is done by comparing the random 
effect spatial autoregressive model and spatial error model (SEM) random effect 
based on the value and Akaike information criterion (AIC). SEM random effect 
produces the largest value and the smallest AIC.
RESULTS: The selected spatial panel data model in determining the factors that 
influence stunting in children under 5 years of age in Indonesia is the SEM 
random effect based on the largest and AIC compared to other models.
CONCLUSION: Based on the selected model, children under five with malnutrition 
and poor nutrition, receiving Vitamin A, and the average monthly per capita 
expenditure on food have a significant effect on the percentage of stunting in 
children under five in Indonesia.",

low- and middle-income countries. Several studies have reported an association 
between obesity and asthma. However, only a handful of studies have identified 
stunting as a significant risk factor for wheezing, a symptom of asthma, 
although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This article aimed to review 
possible mechanisms underlying asthma in stunted children. Overall, changes in 
diet or nutritional status and deficiencies in certain nutrients, such as 
vitamin D, can increase the risk of developing asthma. Vitamin D deficiency can 
cause linear growth disorders such as stunting in children, with lower levels of 
25(OH)D found in underweight and stunted children. Stunted children show a 
decreased lean body mass, which affects lung growth and function. Low leptin 
levels during undernutrition cause a Th1-Th2 imbalance toward Th2, resulting in 
increased interleukin (IL)-4 cytokine production and total immunoglobulin E 
(IgE). Studies in stunted underweight children have also found an increase in 
the proportion of the total number of B cells with low-affinity IgE receptors 
(CD23+). CD23+ plays an important role in allergen presentation that is 
facilitated by IgE to T cells and strongly activates allergen-specific T cells 
and the secretion of Th2-driving cytokines. Stunted children present with low 
vitamin D and leptin levels, impaired lung growth, decreased lung function, and 
increased IL-4 and CD23+ levels. All of these factors may be considered 
consequential in asthma in stunted children.",

key indicator of children's nutritional status which results from long-term 
deprivation of basic needs. Ethiopia, the largest and most populous country in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, has the greatest rate of stunting among children under the 
age of five, yet the problem is unevenly distributed across the country. Thus, 
we investigate spatial heterogeneity and explore spatial projection of stunting 
among under-five children. Further, spatial predictors of stunting were assessed 
using geospatial regression models.
METHODS: The Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) data from 2011, 
2016, and 2019 were examined using a geostatistical technique that took into 
account spatial autocorrelation. Ordinary kriging was used to interpolate 
stunting data, and Kulldorff spatial scan statistics were used to identify 
spatial clusters with high and low stunting prevalence. In spatial regression 
modeling, the ordinary least square (OLS) model was employed to investigate 
spatial predictors of stunting and to examine local spatial variations 
geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted 
regression (MGWR) models were employed.
RESULTS: Overall, stunting prevalence was decreased from 44.42% [95%, CI: 
0.425-0.444] in 2011 to 36.77% [95%, CI: 0.349-0.375] in 2019. Across three 
waves of EDHS, clusters with a high prevalence of stunting in children under 
5 years were consistently observed in northern Ethiopia stretching in Tigray, 
Amhara, Afar, and Benishangul-Gumuz. Another area of very high stunting 
incidence was observed in the Southern parts of Ethiopia and the Somali region 
of Ethiopia. Our spatial regression analysis revealed that the observed 
geographical variation of under-five stunting significantly correlated with poor 
sanitation, poor wealth index, inadequate diet, residency, and mothers' 
education.
CONCLUSIONS: In Ethiopia, substantial progress has been made in decreasing 
stunting among children under the age of 5 years; although disparities varied in 
some areas and districts between surveys, the pattern generally remained 
constant over time. These findings suggest a need for region and 
district-specific policies where priority should be given to children in areas 
where most likely to exhibit high-risk stunting.",

are important risk factors for illness and death yet, despite the fact that 
these conditions can share common risk factors and are often seen in the same 
child, they are commonly portrayed as relatively distinct manifestations of 
undernutrition. In 2014, the Wasting and Stunting project was launched by the 
Emergency Nutrition Network. Its aim was to better understand the complex 
relationship and associations between wasting and stunting and examine whether 
current separations that were apparent in approaches to policy, financing, and 
programs were justified or useful. Based on the project's work, this article 
aims to bring a wasting and stunting lens to how research is designed and 
financed in order for the nutrition community to better understand, prevent, and 
treat child undernutrition. Discussion of lessons learnt focuses on the synergy 
and temporal relationships between children's weight loss and linear growth 
faltering, the proximal and distal factors that drive diverse forms of 
undernutrition, and identifying and targeting people most at risk. Supporting 
progress in all these areas requires research collaborations across interest 
groups that highlight the value of research that moves beyond a focus on single 
forms of undernutrition, and ensures that there is equal attention given to 
wasting as to other forms of malnutrition, wherever it is present.",

most isolates producing a high amount (>20 ug/µL) of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), and a 
marginal proportion of them also producing G aflatoxins with a higher level of 
aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) than AFB1. Some non-aflatoxigenic A. tamarii demonstrated a 
strong ability to reduce the level of AFB1 by more than 95% when co-inoculated

measured by a pH meter and titration respectively. Proximate composition is 
measured according to Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods. The 
mineral content is determined by atomic spectrophotometry. Results show that 
soy-milk Moringa enriched yoghurts (B and C) are preferred after choosing the 
control (A) as the best. The incorporation of the soy-milk Moringa significantly 
increases the fat, fiber, protein, copper manganese, and iron content in the 
samples (p < 0.05). Thus Moringa enriched soy-milk yoghurts (B and C) represent 
a cheaper alternative to the control (A) providing protein-energy for low income 
families that is expected to help reduce the occurrence of kwashiorkor and

children > 5 years old), anthelmintic treatment intervention, stunting-related 
variables reported (e.g. height, height-for-age z-score, birth weight), helminth 
infection reported in relation to stunting, any geographic location, any date, 
peer-reviewed literature only. Exclusion criteria were: non-primary research, 
study protocols, studies with no new data, non-English language papers and 
animal (non-human) helminth studies. Seven databases were searched on 28 May 
2021. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies and GRADE was used for 
studies included in RCT subgroup meta-analyses (in preschool-age children and 
pregnant women). This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO 
(CRD42021256201).
RESULTS: Eighty studies were included in the analyses. No significant overall 
evidence was found in support of the hypothesis that helminths cause physical 
stunting in children, although there was some association with wasting.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst analyses of the available literature to date failed to 
support a direct association between helminth infection and childhood stunting, 
there was significant heterogeneity between studies, and many had follow-up 
periods which may have been too short to detect impacts on growth. Most apparent 
was a lack of available data from key demographic groups wherein one may predict 
the greatest association of helminth infection with stunting-notably that of 
infants, preschool-age children, and pregnant or nursing women. Thus this review 
highlights the urgent need for further targeted empirical research amongst these 
potentially most vulnerable demographic groups.",

Stunting prevalence is higher in children from poor families or living in rural 
areas; however, there has been a lack of information on predictors of stunting 
disparities and stunting risk factors by socioeconomic status (SES) and location 
of residence (rural or urban). This study aims to examine the factors associated 
with stunting by SES and rural-urban status, and to assess determinants of 
stunting disparities by SES and rural-urban status in Indonesia.
METHODS: This study analysed data from the Indonesian Family and Life Survey 
(IFLS) wave 5, conducted in 2014. Data for 3887 children aged 0-59 months, 
including individual, family and community variables, were analysed. Stratified 
logistic regression was conducted to assess differences in determinants of 
stunting by household expenditure (poor or non-poor, representing SES) and 
rural-urban status. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method was used to assess 
determinants of stunting disparities by household expenditure and rural-urban 
status.
RESULTS: The analyses showed differences in factors associated with stunting 
among children in rural versus urban areas, or children in poor versus non-poor 
households. Mother's short stature and low education level increased the odds of 
stunting across all groups. However, in children of families with a higher 
household expenditure, unhealthy snacks were a significant predictor of stunting 
(adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.47). This 
finding was not found in other groups. Good sanitation significantly reduced 
stunting in children in families with higher household expenditure and children 
from urban communities. Nutrition services were significantly associated with 
stunting in poor children and children from urban areas. The decomposition 
analyses showed that differences in characteristics explained 55.35% stunting 
disparity by household expenditure. Meanwhile, rural-urban disparity was mostly 
explained by differences in responses (56.20%), with low birth weight and 
unexplained variables as predominant contributors.
CONCLUSION: There were slight differences in stunting determinants by household 
expenditure and rural-urban status in Indonesia. Stunting disparities were 
attributed to differences in characteristics and responses between the less and 
more advantaged populations. To improve the effectiveness of stunting reduction 
programs, specific interventions tailored to address the differences between the 
more and less advantaged population are needed.",

are vulnerable to early childhood stunting. There are contradictory reports of 
the association between catch-up growth in childhood and school age cognition.
METHODS: A community-based birth cohort recruited between 2010 and 2012 from 
urban slums in Vellore, India was followed up until 9 years of age. From regular 
anthropometric measurements, stunting status for each individual child was 
calculated at 2, 5 and 9 years. Cognition was assessed at 9 years of age using 
the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC). Children were 
divided into groups based on stunting at each time point as well as catch-up 
growth, and a regression model was utilised to evaluate their association with 
cognition at 9 years.
RESULTS: Among 203 children included in this analysis, 94/203 (46.31%) children 
were stunted at 2 years of age, of whom 39.36% had a catch-up growth at 5 years 
of age, and 38.30% at 9 years. Around 10% of the cohort remained stunted at all 
time points. In the multivariable analysis, children who were stunted at 2, 5 
and 9 years had a significantly lower verbal and total intelligence quotient 
(IQ) scores by 4.6 points compared to those who were never stunted. Children 
with catch up growth following stunting at 2 years had higher cognition scores 
than those who were persistently stunted throughout the childhood.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed persistent stunting in childhood was associated 
with lowering of 4-5 IQ points in childhood cognition at 9 years of age. 
Recovery from early life stunting in children with catch up growth prevented 
further lowering of cognition scores in these children compared to persistently 
stunted children. Nutritional supplementation during late infancy and early 
toddlerhood in addition to continuing nutritional supplementation programmes for 
preschool and school children can improve childhood stunting and cognitive 
abilities in vulnerable populations.",

especially in developing countries. In Lesotho, their prevalence is high, 
particularly among children less than 5 years of age.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the association between 
anaemia and stunting, and identify factors relating to both conditions among 
children younger than 5 years in Lesotho.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used secondary data from 3112 children 
collected during the 2014 Lesotho Demographic Health Survey (LDHS). Haemoglobin 
(Hb) levels were adjusted for altitude and a level less than 11 g per deciliters 
(11 g/dl) was determined as the cutoff for being anaemic. A child with the 
height-for-age z score (HAZ) below minus two standard deviations (SD) was 
considered to have stunting. We linked factors relating to anaemia and stunting 
using a multivariate joint model under the scope of the generalized linear mixed 
model (GLMM).
RESULTS: The prevalence of anaemia and stunting in children younger than 5 years 
were 51% and 43% respectively. The multivariate results revealed a strong 
association between anaemia and stunting. In addition, maternal education, urban 
vs. rural residence, wealth index and childbirth weight significantly impacted 
childhood stunting or malnutrition, while having fever and/or diarrhoea was 
linked to anaemia. Lastly, age was shown to have a significant effect on both 
stunting and anaemia.
CONCLUSION: Anaemia and stunting or malnutrition showed linked longitudinal 
trajectories, suggesting both conditions could lead to synergetic improvements 
in overall child health. Demographic, socio-economic, and geographical 
characteristics were also important drivers of stunting and anaemia in children 
younger than 5 years. Thus, children living in similar resources settings as 
Lesotho could benefit from coordinated programs designed to address both 
malnutrition and anaemia.",

prevalence exhibits considerable geographical variation. We apply Bayesian 
geostatistical modelling to study the spatial pattern of stunting in children 
less than five years considering anthropometric, socioeconomic and demographic 
risk factors in Rwanda. In addition, we predict the spatial residuals effects to 
quantify the burden of stunting not accounted for by our geostatistical model.
METHODS: We used the data from the 2015 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. We 
fitted two spatial logistic models with similar structures, only differentiated 
by the inclusion or exclusion of spatially structured random effects.
RESULTS: The risk factors of stunting identified in the geostatistical model 
were being male (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.47), lower birthweight (kg) 
(OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95, 0.97), non-exclusive breastfeeding (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 
1.04, 1.45), occurrence of diarrhoea in the last two weeks (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 
1.02, 1.37), a lower proportion of mothers with overweight (BMI ≥ 25) 
(OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.95), a higher proportion of mothers with no or only 
primary education (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.36). Also, a higher probability of 
living in a house with poor flooring material (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.41), 
reliance on a non-improved water source (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.27), and a 
low wealth index were identified as risk factors of stunting. Mapping of the 
spatial residuals effects showed that, in particular, the Northern and Western 
regions, followed by the Southern region of Rwanda, still exhibit a higher risk 
of stunting even after accounting for all the covariates in the spatial model.
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to identify the still unknown spatially 
explicit factors associated with higher risk of stunting. Finally, given the 
spatial heterogeneity of stunting, interventions to reduce stunting should be 
geographically targeted.",

as a potentially important correlate of stunting. Our objective was to examine 
the association between solid cookfuel use and stunting in children aged &lt;5 
y.
METHODS: We used data from 59 LMICs' population-based cross-sectional 
demographic and health surveys; 557 098 children aged &lt;5 y were included in 
our analytical sample. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the 
association between exposure to solid cookfuel use and childhood stunting, 
adjusting for child sex, age, maternal education and number of children living 
in the household. We explored the association across key subgroups.
RESULTS: Solid cookfuel use was associated with child stunting (adjusted OR 
1.58, 95% CI 1.55 to 1.61). Children living in households using solid cookfuels 
were more likely to be stunted if they lived in rural areas, the poorest 
households, had a mother who smoked tobacco or were from the Americas.
CONCLUSIONS: Focused strategies to reduce solid cookfuel exposure might 
contribute to reductions in childhood stunting in LMICs. Trial evidence to 
assess the effect of reducing solid cookfuel exposure on childhood stunting is 
urgently needed.",

inequity in the region and its effect on malnutrition which leads to mortality 
and reduced economic development in this region, the current study purposed to 
examine the prevalence of stunting as an indicator of chronic malnutrition in 
the MENA region, with consideration given HDI, rural/urban area, and 
war-involved countries.
METHODS: The electronic databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of science, and Embase 
were systematically searched, and English-language articles published between 
January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 were included in this study. The POLIS 
(population, outcome, location, indicator, study design) criteria were used to 
perform the systematic review, and studies involving children 2 to 18 years of 
age were selected.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight (n = 2 202 869) were included based on the study's 
inclusion criteria. The prevalence of stunting in children in the total MENA 
region was 22.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 20.4-23.6; I2  = 99.92%, 
P < 0.0001). The studies included in the meta-analysis were analyzed by 
subgroups. The pooled prevalence of stunting in children aged 2-5 years old and 
children aged 6 and older was 25.7% and 16.5%, respectively. The pooled 
prevalence of stunting was 34.1% in rural and 12.4% in urban areas. The pooled 
prevalence of stunting according to HDI was 30.1%, 28.5%, 13.1%, in low, medium, 
and high HDI countries, respectively. Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of 
stunting according to war status was 28.5% in war-involved countries vs 20.6% in

stunting, with 53.3% (95% confidence interval: 52.0-54.6%). Multivariable 
analyses revealed four common factors that increased the odds of a child's 
stunting across all age subgroups: poor households, geopolitical zone (northwest 
or northeast), being a male and maternal height (<145 cm). Interventional 
strategies focused on poverty mitigation through cash transfer and educating low 
socioeconomic mothers on the benefits of gender-neutral supplementary feeding 
and the timely monitoring of the offspring of short mothers would substantially

villages in rural Eastern Indonesia. Data on breastfeeding history, childcare, 
and household expenditures were collected using structured questionnaires. Focus 
Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted in each village (n = 14). Nearly 
two-thirds (61%) of caregivers who identified as the biological mother 
exclusively breastfed their child at 6 months. Exclusively-breastfed CU2 from 
poorer households were 20% less likely to be stunted than their 
non-exclusively-breastfed peers. Further, exclusively-breastfed CU2 from 
wealthier households were 50% less likely to be stunted than 
non-exclusively-breastfed CU2 from poorer households. FGDs revealed that some 
mothers were unaware of the importance of recommended breastfeeding practices.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted on electronic databases such as 
ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar to identify relevant 
published articles from January 1, 2010, to July 1, 2020. Additional articles 
were identified from the reference lists and grey literature.
RESULT: Three main phases require the optimal mother roles to prevent stunting 
in children during the golden phase. These phases include the preconception 
phase, the prenatal phase, and the infant-toddlerhood phase. Various mother 
roles include fulfilling maternal, fetal, infant, and child nutrition, carrying 
out early breastfeeding initiation, exclusive breastfeeding, and appropriate 
complementary feeding, optimizing the environment for child development, 
optimizing family support, and avoiding various psychosocial factors that can be 
detrimental during growth, and child development.
CONCLUSION: The mother roles in the golden phase are crucial to preventing 
stunting in children. Although the conception period does not have a fetus, 
early strengthening of maternal nutrition must be done so that the mother's body 
is ready to undergo the prenatal phase for fetal development, which then 
continues in the infant phase - toddlerhood to adolescence.",

the dietary intake with 24-hour recall. The dietary diversity and dietary 
patterns was measured by the FFQ (Food Frequency Questioner) form for children.
RESULTS: The results showed that a lack of energy intake associated with 
children stunted was 132 (44.9%) (p=0.050), and lacked fat intake was 125 
(45.6%) (p<0.050). For the dietary diversity there is a relationship with 
stunted at a mean value of 7.51±0.87 (p<0.050). As for the dietary pattern, 
there is a relationship between insufficient of consumption nuts and stunted 
(p=0.019) and foods containing sugar (p=0.050) also, namely 135 (45.3%) and 103 
(43.8%).
CONCLUSION: Stunting in children is related to the quality and quantity of food.",

observed a significant increase in the coverage of safe drinking water and 
adequate sanitation facilities over the period. At the national level, the use 
of a basic water source increased from 18% in 2000 to 50% in 2016. Open 
defecation declined from 82% to 32% over the same period. However, in 2016, only 
6% of households had access to a basic sanitation facility, and 40% of 
households had no handwashing facilities. The reduction in surface water use 
between 2000 and 2016 explained 6% of the decline in diarrhoea observed among 
children aged 0-5 months. In children aged 6-59 months, between 7% and 9% of the 
reduction in stunting were attributable to the reduction in open defecation over 
this period. Despite progress, improvements are still needed to increase basic 
WASH coverage in Ethiopia. Our findings showed that improvements in water and 
sanitation only modestly explained reductions in diarrhoea and stunting.",

Methods: The survey was carried out with 1?1 case-control study design in the communities and kindergartens of nine cities (Beijing, Harbin, Xi'an, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming) from June to November in 2016. Children of heights lower than the 3rd percentile according to the 2009 children's height standard in China were included as the stunting case group (n=1 281), and those with normal height matched for geolocation, gender, and age were recruited as the control group (n=1 281). The height and weight were measured on site, and the information related to family, perinatal status, diet and feeding, lifestyle, and medical history was collected by questionnaire. Continuous variables were compared by paired samples t test and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed ranks test, and proportions were compared by paired Chi square test. Multivariate analysis were carried out using conditional Logistic regression model. Results: Among 1 281 pairs of stunting and control group, there were 677 pairs of boys and 604 pairs of girls, with 238 pairs of children under age 3 years and 1 043 pairs of children aged 3 to 7 years. The Z scores for height and weight of stunting group were lower than that of control group (-2.27 (-2.54, -2.08) vs. -0.59 (-1.04, -0.10), -1.85 (-2.35, -1.38) vs. -0.69 (-1.20, -0.21), Z=30.982, 25.580, both P<0.01). Among family related factors, parental education level, height, weight, and height of grandparents in stunting children were all lower than those in control group (all P<0.05). Among individual related factors, proportion of preterm birth, low birth weight, shorter birth length, mother's pregnancy complications, difficulties adding milk or complementary feeding, poor appetite, slow eating, picky and partial eating, passive eating, more snack intake, shorter sleep duration, difficulty falling asleep, disturbed sleep, and recurrent infectious diseases in infant in stunting children were all higher than those in control group (all P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis results illustrate that the lower the parental education level and the parental height, the higher the risk of stunting. For example, the risk of stunting in children whose fathers had short stature was 6.46 times (95%CI: 2.73-15.30) of those children whose fathers' height were medium and the risk of stunting in children whose mothers were short stature was 10.56 times (95%CI: 4.92-22.69) of those children whose mothers' height were medium. The risks of stunting increase significantly among preterm children or those with low birth weight (OR=2.27, 95%CI: 1.33-3.88), birth length<45 cm (OR=3.56, 95%CI: 1.41-8.98), difficulties adding milk or complementary feeding (OR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.32-3.15), poor appetite (OR=3.20, 95%CI: 1.74-5.89), slow eating (OR=1.85, 95%CI: 1.31-2.63), and food allergy (OR=1.80, 95%CI: 1.02-3.16).

examining his own diarrheal stool, but, ironically, it did not really gain 
attention as a human pathogen until the 1960s, when outbreaks were reported. Key 
technological advances, including in vitro cultivation, genomic and proteomic 
databases, and advances in microscopic and molecular approaches, have led to an 
understanding that this is a eukaryotic organism with a reduced genome rather 
than a truly premitochondriate eukaryote. This has included the discovery of 
mitosomes (vestiges of mitochondria), a transport system with many of the 
features of the Golgi apparatus, and even evidence for a sexual or parasexual 
cycle. Cell biology approaches have led to a better understanding of how Giardia 
survives with two nuclei and how it goes through its life cycle as a noninvasive 
organism in the hostile environment of the lumen of the host intestine. Studies 
of its immunology and pathogenesis have moved past the general understanding of 
the importance of the antibody response in controlling infection to determining 
the key role of the Th17 response. This work has led to understanding of the 
requirement for a balanced host immune response that avoids the extremes of an 
excessive response with collateral damage or one that is unable to clear the 
organism. This understanding is especially important in view of the remarkable 
ranges of early manifestations, which range from asymptomatic to persistent 
diarrhea and weight loss, and longer-term sequelae that include growth stunting 
in children who had no obvious symptoms and a high frequency of postinfectious

In a randomised control trial, 971 children aged 6-72 months received either 'Chispuditos' (n = 681), a hot drink (atole) fortified with micronutrients (atole + MN) (9 mg/zinc, 12.5 mg/iron), or lactose-free milk (n = 290) for 18 months. Primary outcomes were changes in length/height-for-age (HAZ) score and the prevalence of stunting at 18-month follow-up. Adherence was monitored monthly, and 73% children in atole + MN group consumed at least half their daily zinc and iron requirement. At 18 months, there was no difference between the treatments in growth [mean change in HAZ -0.02 (95% CI -0.12, 0.08)] or stunting [atole + MN 41%, milk 41%; RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.84, 1.19)].

nutrition security outcomes such as stunting in children under 5. However, 
stunting and HIV/AIDS are highly gendered phenomena that need to be explored in 
order to get an in-depth understanding of the interrelationship. This study was 
therefore aimed at investigating gender dimensions of the impact of HIV/AIDS on 
stunting in children under 5 years in Zimbabwe.
METHODS: The study uses a large scale nationally representative cross-sectional 
dataset of 13,854 Zimbabwean households for the year 2019. To test hypothesis 1, 
the study employs binary choice models (Probit and Logit) since the outcome 
variable household HIV/AIDS status is dichotomous. To test hypothesis 2 and 3, 
the study employs the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach to circumvent the 
self-selection problem in the creation of treatment and control groups for 
households affected by HIV/AIDS and those that are not.
RESULTS: The results revealed that household HIV/AIDS status is independent of 
the gender of household head. On the other hand, the results for the PSM 
estimates show that the probability of the household having a stunted child 
under 5 years is higher for households with an HIV positive member compared to 
those without. In addition, female headed households with an HIV positive member 
are more likely to have a stunted child under 5 years compared to male headed 
households under similar circumstances.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the results provide evidence of a higher risk of stunting 
among children from households affected by HIV/AIDS. The study offers three 
major findings. Firstly, the study finds no significant association between 
gender of the household head and household HIV/AIDS status. Secondly, households 
that have at least one HIV positive member are more likely to have a stunted 
child under 5 years. Lastly, female headed households with at least one HIV 
positive member are more likely to have a stunted child under 5 years compared 
to male headed household with similar HIV/AIDS status. The findings have 
important policy implications towards improved integration of HIV/AIDS status, 
household head gender and child nutrition services in affected households.",

Identifying the determinants of severe stunting among children is crucial for 
public health interventions to improve child health. Therefore, this study aimed 
to identify the determinants of severe stunting among under-five children in 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. A two 
stage stratified cluster sampling technique was used. A multilevel ordinal 
logistic regression model was fitted to identify independent determinants. 
Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and median odds ratio (MOR) with its 95% confidence 
interval at p-value< 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.
RESULTS: The result of this study showed that about 18% of the children were 
severely stunted. Being male increased the severity of stunting in children by 
26% adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.26 (95% CI: 1.09-1.46), compared to female sex; 
over-weight mothers increased the severity of stunting in their children AOR: 
3.43 (95% CI: 2.21-5.33) compared to normal BMI mothers; and children from 
middle, poorer, and poorest wealth index households were 1.84 (95% 
CI:1.27-2.67), 2.13 (95% CI, CI:1.45-3.14) and 2.52 (95% CI,1.72-3.68). In 
contrast, severe stunting was reduced by 62% (AOR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20-0.74) and 
48% (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.72) in children of educated mothers compared to 
children of uneducated mothers and children of underweight mothers compared with 
those children of normal BMI mothers respectively. For each one-unit increase in 
maternal height, there is a 5% significant reduction in the child's odds of 
being severely stunted. After controlling for other factors, the effect of 
predictors on the likelihood of stunting in high risk clusters increased by a 
median odds ratio (MOR) of 1.83 (95% CI: 1.69-2.00).
CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of severe childhood stunting was still high with 
regional variation in Ethiopia. Child age, sex, maternal height, age, education 
and household wealth index as well as administrative regions were significantly 
associated factors with severe stunting. Significant interventions shall be 
implemented at the individual, household and community levels in order to reduce 
the problem.",

undernutrition because it is associated with suboptimal brain development and 
the subsequent increased risk of metabolic diseases and decreased earnings in 
adult life. The Sambas District in Indonesia has a high prevalence of stunting 
(28.4%), followed by underweight (25.5.%) and wasting (14.4%) among children, as 
well chronic energy deficiency (27%) and anemia (62%) among pregnant women. The 
present study sought to determine significant factors in childhood stunting with 
a focus on maternal and child nutrition and prenatal and postnatal determinants.
METHODS: This prospective, repeat, cross-sectional study investigated factors 
associated with stunting among 559 infants age 0-11 months in Sambas District, 
Indonesia. Anthropometric measurements were performed by trained enumerators. 
Data from a 2016 survey of pregnant women and a 2017 survey on mothers and their 
children were used for postnatal data collection to quantify the prevalence of 
stunting at age 0-11 months. Using 20 potential predictors of stunting 
categorized by household characteristics, maternal characteristics, antenatal 
care services, and child characteristics, logistic regression analysis was 
conducted to assess the adjusted association between stunting and these factors.
RESULTS: Of 559 children analyzed, 20.8% were stunted. In the model with low 
birth weight (LBW) as predictor for stunting, the odds of stunting increased 
significantly among children who weighed <2.500 g at birth; children who had 
diarrhea in the past 2 weeks and children who had incomplete basic immunization 
coverage as infants age 9-11 months. In model without LBW, the odds of stunting 
increased significantly among children who had preterm at birth, short maternal 
stature and children who had incomplete basic immunization coverage for 9-11 
months infants.
CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal factors-preterm birth, low birth weight, diarrhea and 
complete basic immunization coverage-were associated with infant stunting in 
Sambas District, Indonesia. The prenatal factors such as short maternal stature 
were significant in the multivariate model. Policy makers, especially in the 
government, should recommend measures focused on those prenatal and postnatal 
factors to prevent stunting in children and to avoid the sequelae of childhood 
stunting in adult life.",

countries. This study assessed the prevalence of stunting and associated risk 
factors of stunting among preschool and school-going children in flood-affected 
areas of Pakistan. A cross-sectional study was conducted by visiting 656 
households through multi-stage sampling. Respondent's anthropometric 
measurements, socio-demographic information and sanitation facilities were 
explored. A logistic regression model was used to determine determinants of 
stunting, controlling for all possible confounders. The overall prevalence of 
stunting in children was 40.5%, among children 36.1% boys and 46.3% of girls 
were stunted. The prevalence of stunting in under-five children was 50.7%. 
Female children (OR=1.35, 95% CI:0.94-2.0), children aged 13-24 months (OR=6.5, 
95% CI: 3.0-13.9), mothers aged 15-24 years (OR=4.4, 95% CI: 2.6-7.2), joint 
family (OR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.0) did not have access to improved drinking water 
(OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.9-5.9), and the toilet facility (OR=2.8, 95% CI, 1.9-4.3), 
while the children from district Nowshera (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 0.9-3.2) were 
significantly (P<0.05) associated in univariate analysis. The regression model 
revealed that child age, maternal age, family type, quality of water, and toilet 
facility, were the significant (P<0.05) factors contributing to child stunting 
in the flood-hit areas. Identification of key factors might be helpful for 
policymakers in designing comprehensive community-based programs for the 
reduction of stunting in flood-affected areas. In disasters such as flood, the 
detrimental consequences of the stunting problem could be even more on children. 
Evidence-based education and care must be provided to the families in the 
flood-affected regions to reduce the stunting problem. The determinants of 
stunting should be targeted by making comprehensive policies regarding proper 
nutrition, livelihood, clean water, and sanitation facilities in flood-hit 
regions.",

of Peru. Chronic fascioliasis can be asymptomatic and remain undiagnosed for 
years. Chronic malnutrition in children, as manifested by stunting, leads to 
delayed cognitive development and lost productivity. We hypothesized that 
fascioliasis is among the factors associated with stunting in children from 
endemic areas. We conducted a cross-sectional study among children attending 
pre-school and school in 26 communities in the Anta province in the Cusco region 
of Peru. We conducted interviews to collect information on demographic, 
socioeconomic, and medical history. Blood was collected and tested for complete 
cell count and FAS2 ELISA for Fasciola antibodies. Three stool samples per 
participant were tested for parasites by Kato-Katz and Lumbreras rapid 
sedimentation methods. Chronic fascioliasis was determined by the presence of 
ova in stool. Children's height, weight, and age were recorded and used to 
calculate height for age Z scores (HAZ). Three thousand children participated in 
the study. Nine percent (264) of children had at least one positive test for 
Fasciola infection, 6% (164) had chronic fascioliasis, and 3% (102) had only 
positive antibody tests. The median HAZ was -1.41 (IQR: -2.03 to -0.81) and was 
similar in males and females. Twenty six percent (776) of children had stunting 
with HAZ < -2. Children with chronic fascioliasis had a lower median HAZ than 
children without Fasciola (-1.54 vs. -1.4, p = 0.014). History of treatment for 
malnutrition, history of treatment for anemia, having other helminths in stool, 
lower socioeconomic score, living at a higher elevation, and fewer years of 
schooling of both parents were associated with a lower HAZ score. In a multiple 
regression analysis, older age and a lower socioeconomic score were associated 
with a lower HAZ score. While fascioliasis and other helminths were associated 
with lower HAZ, they were not independent of the socioeconomic score.",

disasters. Children from low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately 
affected. The impacts of exposure to multiple natural disasters on the 
development of children are not well understood. The Philippines had 6.5 million 
people affected by natural disasters in 2018 and is therefore an ideal country 
in which to study the cumulative effects of natural disasters on human 
development.
METHODS: We used wave 1 (2016-17) of the Longitudinal Cohort Study on the 
Filipino Child, a nationally representative cohort study of 4952 10-year-old 
children, to examine the impact of natural disasters. For caregivers, we 
examined mental health, family violence, and food insecurity. For children, we 
examined exposure to violence and stunting. We used random effects models to 
estimate the associations between natural disasters and children's development 
outcomes and caregivers' outcomes, after adjusting for neighbourhood, 
demographic, and geographic variables. Disaster exposure was measured using 
caregiver-reported measures of cumulative exposure and cumulative impact of 
disasters, average neighbourhood reports and data linked from the International 
Disaster Database (EM-DAT), an independent measure of community exposure to 
disaster.
FINDINGS: We found that experiencing natural disasters, as measured by 
neighbourhood reports, was associated with higher levels of family violence in 
the previous 12 months, parenting stress, children witnessing physical violence, 
physical abuse of children, stunting in children, and greater food insecurity. 
Associations with individual self-reported exposure showed was similar. 
Associations with natural disasters measured using EM-DAT data showed a similar 
pattern: exposure to greater numbers of natural disasters was associated with 
higher levels of family violence, physical abuse of children, stunting in 
children, and food insecurity. Impacts of disasters was associated with higher 
levels of family violence, depression and food insecurity.
INTERPRETATION: This is the first national study to document that cumulative 
measures of natural disasters had small, but wide-ranging, impacts on children 
and their caregivers. Further research is needed to identify factors that will 
protect populations who are at risk of high levels of natural disasters to 
ensure the optimal development of children.

are at high risk for infection and illness with TB. Nutritional status 
(stunting) in children is related to the child's ability to withstand MTB 
(Mycobacterium Tuberculosis). This study aims to estimated the prevalence of 
tuberculosis infection and its relationship to stunting in children (under five 
years) with household contact (HHC) with new TB cases.
METHODS: A cross-sectional design was implemented. Conducted in July 2018-April 
2019 at 13 Public Health Center in Makassar City. The sample size was calculated 
using one sample situation-about precision formula. Samples were children under 
five who had contact with new diagnosed TB cases. Tuberculosis infection was 
measured by TST (tuberculin skin test). Logistic regression with causal model to 
examine TB infection relationship with stunting and covariate variable, analyzed 
using Stata/MP 13.0 software.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six (126) eligible children. Prevalence of 
tuberculosis infection was 38.10%. Frequency of stunted was 31 children 
(24.60%). Stunted nutritional status (aPR): 2.36, 95% CI 1.60-3.44), boys (aPR:

According to the 2015 National Survey of the Nutritional Situation in Colombia the prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years of age was 10.8%. In terms of region, Bogot, presented the highest prevalence rate (13%), a figure that exceeded national records. With the collaboration of local and national government, and nongovernmental it was decided to develop a pilot study involving a public health intervention with residents of Bogot under 1 year of age with nutritional classification by anthropometry compatible with stunting risk or stunting.

Methods
Pre-experimental, before and after study that sought to determine the magnitude of the change in nutritional status through a 10 months public health nutrition intervention in children under one-year-old residing in 3 prioritized territories of Bogot.

Results
The intervention comprised 1126 children living in the following territories in Bogot: Kennedy, San Cristbal, and Engativ. A total of 43.3% children presented delay in height for age, and 56.7% presented risk of short stature. In the final measurement, data were obtained from 686 children, identifying that 17% of the children progressed from stunting to a stunting risk and that 4.5% recovered their growth trajectory, achieving an adequate length for their age.

Conclusion
That children classified as at risk or stunting at the beginning of the intervention showed an increased probability of approaching or being in the appropriate growth trajectory according to the length-for-age indicator after the intervention.",

on malnutrition risk in children was conducted.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review published evidence pertaining to the effect 
of dental caries severity and prevalence on risk of wasting or stunting in 
children.
METHODS: Four questions relating to caries of the permanent dentition, primary 
dentition, early childhood caries (ECC), and severe ECC as a risk factor for 
undernutrition were set. The target population was children aged 0 to 18 y from 
any country. Data sources included MEDLINE and Embase. All human epidemiological 
studies were included. Quality assessment excluded lowest-quality studies. 
Evidence synthesis by vote counting was depicted using harvest plots. A best 
available evidence approach was applied to narrative synthesis. The review was 
conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
RESULTS: Of the 2,690 studies identified, 447 were screened in duplicate; of 
these, 117 underwent quality assessment, resulting in 46 included studies, of 
which 38 were included in vote counting (3 quasi-experimental, 1 cohort, 1 case 
control, and 33 cross-sectional studies). For the permanent dentition, findings 
were mixed; the balance of data showed no association between caries prevalence 
(7/11 studies) or severity (8/17 studies) with wasting. For the primary 
dentition, the balance of data showed a positive association between caries 
prevalence (10/15 studies) and severity (12/15 studies) with wasting, as well as 
between-caries prevalence (4/5 studies) and severity (6/6 studies) with 
stunting. Considering ECC only did not alter this pattern of findings.
CONCLUSION: The balance of evidence suggests that dental caries in the primary 
dentition is associated with undernutrition. There is a need for well-designed 
trials on the impact of caries rehabilitation on growth trajectories of children 
from low- and middle-income countries and for prospective studies of the impact 
of caries severity on both stunting and wasting to confirm causality.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study can be used by policy 
makers when considering the importance of oral health in addressing the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goal to end all forms of malnutrition. The 
findings suggest that dental caries in the primary dentition may impair 
children's healthy weight gain. The findings indicate that higher-quality data 
are required to confirm a causal relationship and thus inform funding bodies of 
the need for research, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to 
substantiate the current knowledge and inform clear and accurate policy 
statements.",

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data of 380 families in 15 districts of the 
central region of Peru. WHO criteria were used to define stunting prediction 
model.
METHODS: An explanatory and predictive study of stunting in children was carried 
out considering causality criteria through Chi-square tests and bivariate 
logistic regression. Family food production, maternal education, breastfeeding 
practices and others determinant related to rural zone conditions were 
considered as explanatory variables in stunting of children under 5 years old. 
Three exhaustive models for predicted the presence of stunting was developed.
RESULTS: Stunting percentage was 40.3. To Hosmer and Lemeshow test, the best fit 
was the model that considered the level of maternal education, timely 
consumption of colostrum, birth weight and guinea pig rearing, having high 
reliability (P ​< ​0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model for early detection of stunting risk in rural 
areas of the Andean region was developed based on simple and easily applied 
indicators. Effective policies are required to improve the feeding practices of 
pregnant women, increase breastfeeding and promote guinea pig raising for 
self-consumption and improve the nutritional status of children.",

need for a broader interdisciplinary cross-sectoral approach in which 
disciplines such as the environment and health have to work together to 
co-develop integrated socio-culturally tailored interventions. However, there 
remains scant evidence for the development and application of such integrated, 
multifactorial child health interventions across India's most rural communities. 
In this paper we explore and demonstrate the linkages between environmental 
factors and stunting thereby highlighting the scope for interdisciplinary 
research. We examine the associations between household environmental 
characteristics and stunting in children under 5 years of age across rural 
Rajasthan, India. We used Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)-3 India 
(2005-2006) data from 1194 children living across 109,041 interviewed 
households. Multiple logistic regression analyses independently examined the 
association between (i) the primary source of drinking water, (ii) primary type 
of sanitation facilities, (iii) primary cooking fuel type, and (iv) agricultural 
land ownership and stunting adjusting for child age. The results suggest, after 
adjusting for child age, household access to (i) improved drinking water source 
was associated with 23% decreased odds [odds ratio (OR) = 0.77, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.5-1.00], (ii) improved sanitation facility was associated with 
41% decreased odds (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.3-0.82), and (iii) agricultural land 
ownership was associated with 30% decreased odds of childhood stunting (OR 0.70, 
95% CI 0.51-0.94]. The cooking fuel source was not associated with stunting. Our 
findings indicate that a shift is needed from nutrition-specific to contextually 
appropriate interdisciplinary solutions, which incorporate environmental 
improvements. This will not only improve living conditions in deprived 
communities but also help to tackle the challenge of childhood malnutrition 
across India's most vulnerable communities.",

status and morbidity in children as water- and sanitation-related diseases are 
the leading causes of early morbidity and mortality in children. The present 
study was conducted to assess the nutritional status as well as personal hygiene 
practices of primary school going children.
METHOD: The present study was a cross-sectional study conducted in selected 
urban and rural areas of Shillong in children 6-12 years of age. Two schools 
each from the rural and urban area were selected using simple random sampling. 
The total sample size calculated was 510. Height, weight, and BMI were taken for 
all the children following the standard procedures. WHO growth standards were 
used for grading of nutritional status. A questionnaire with scores was used for 
grading of personal hygiene status.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of underweight in the children of 6-9 years was 
74 (18.7%) and that of stunting was 68 (17.2%). The overall prevalence of 
thinness and stunting in children aged 10-12 was 38 (19.1%) and 46 (23.2%). The 
prevalence of nutritional deficiency syndromes was 192 (32.4%). Regarding the

small amount can cause chemical burns in the esophagus, with esophageal 
stricture being the most common late complication.
METHODS: We enrolled children with alkaline corrosive damage receiving treatment 
at China Medical University Children's Hospital's emergency department between 
2008 and 2018. Patients were divided into groups A (ingested causative agents 
other than alkaline oil), and B (ingested alkaline oil).
RESULTS: Altogether, 40 (27 [67.5%] male and 13 [32.5%] female) patients aged 7 
months-7 years were enrolled. The most commonly ingested agent was alkaline oil 
(13 cases, 32.5%), followed by oven and drainage cleaners (8 cases, 20%), bleach 
(6 cases, 15%), laundry and dish cleaners (4 cases, 10%), sodium hydroxide (4 
cases, 10%), sodium carbonate (2 cases, 5%), sodium phosphate (2 cases, 5%), and 
sodium citrate (1 case, 2.5%). High proportions of children had esophagitis 
(40/40, 100%), erosive gastritis (7/40, 17.5%), and gastric ulcer (6/40, 15%). 
The incidence of esophageal stricture was 38.4% (5/13) and 7.4% (2/27) in groups 
B and A, respectively. In group B, 4 children developed growth stunting or 
malnutrition during the first decade after onset, with reduced immunity and 
feelings of inferiority.
CONCLUSION: Alkaline ingestion usually results in esophageal injury that is 
difficult to cure. Corrosive esophageal strictures cause swallowing difficulties 
and growth stunting in children. Young children who ingested alkaline oil have 
more complications. Given that alkaline corrosive injuries are often accidental, 
prevention of corrosive agent ingestion is crucial.",

stunting in children after birth. We found that children born in the districts 
using firewood or charcoal as a main cooking fuel are shorter on average after 
birth. The estimated impacts are sizable: for example, by switching cooking fuel 
from dirty fuels to LPG, the average height for age Z score in the sample would 
increase from -1.269 to -0.43. The gender dimensions of the household air 
pollution effects were further explored. Boys were found to take a worse hit 
from in utero exposures compared to girls. The findings imply that policy to 
enhance clean cooking fuel use will help reduce child stunting in developing 
countries. An increase in clean cooking fuel usage and a reduction in child 
stunting are both necessary to support the success of the SDGs.",

mothers' adoption of healthy home practices in low- and middle-income countries. 
However, little is known regarding how best to train them for the capabilities 
and cultural competencies needed to support maternal health behavior change. We 
tested a CHW training method, Sharing Histories (SH), in which CHWs recount 
their own childbearing and childrearing experiences on which to build new 
learning.
METHODS: We conducted an embedded cluster-randomized trial in rural Peru in 18 
matched clusters. Each cluster was a primary health facility catchment area. 
Government health staff trained female CHWs using SH (experimental clusters) or 
standard training methods (control clusters). All other training and 
system-strengthening interventions were equal between study arms. All CHWs 
conducted home visits with pregnant women and children aged 0-23 months to 
teach, monitor health practices and danger signs, and refer. The primary outcome 
was height-for-age (HAZ)<-2 Z-scores (stunting) in children aged 0-23 months. 
Household surveys were conducted at baseline (606 cases) and 4-year follow-up 
(606 cases).
RESULTS: Maternal and child characteristics were similar in both study arms at 
baseline and follow-up. Difference-in-differences analysis showed mean HAZ 
changes were not significantly different in experimental versus control clusters 
from baseline to endline (P=.469). However, in the subgroup of literate mothers, 
mean HAZ improved by 1.03 on the Z-score scale in experimental clusters compared 
to control clusters from baseline to endline (P=.059). Using generalized 
estimating equations, we demonstrated that stunting in children of mothers who 
were literate was significantly reduced (Beta=0.77; 95% confidence 
interval=0.23, 1.31; P<.01), adjusting for covariates.
CONCLUSION: Compared with standard training methods, SH may have improved the 
effectiveness of CHWs as change agents among literate mothers to reduce child 
stunting. Stunting experienced by the children of illiterate mothers may have 
involved unaddressed determinants of stunting.",

exposure through poor water, sanitation, and hygiene) are two critical factors 
that impact the health outcomes of the populxation. This is particularly 
relevant for vulnerable age groups such as pregnant women and children <5 years, 
who bear long-lasting and intergenerational consequences of impoverished

first time, an analysis of indispensable amino acid (IAA) requirements for 
pregnant women, separately for the second and third trimesters, using protein 
accretion data from a recent Indian study. Furthermore, using these estimates 
for pregnancy, and the current IAA requirements for young children, the quality 
of protein was assessed in Indian diets consumed by pregnant women and children 
(1-3 and 4-6 years) from national representative rural National Nutrition 
Monitoring Bureau survey. The assessment was considered in the context of an 
adverse environment and in relation to outcomes such as LBW, stunting, and 
underweight. Finally, an assessment was made of the proportion of the surveyed 
population at risk of dietary quality protein inadequacy and implications for 
planning nutrition intervention programmes. Specifically, state-wise estimates 
of the risk of quality protein inadequacy are provided, in addition to

RESULTS: Ethiopia is off-track in meeting the five global nutrition targets 
studied. The national AARR of stunting is 2.3 against a target of 5.3, for 
wasting the current AARR is 3.1 against a target of 5.3. The AARR of 
non-exclusive breastfeeding was 2.1 close to the target of 2.7. Anemia in women 
of reproductive age increased across all the regions of Ethiopia. The majority 
of Ethiopian regions were on track to achieving the overweight and exclusive 
breastfeeding targets by 2025. There is an urgent need to address anemia in 
Ethiopian women of reproductive age because its prevalence has been increasing. 
Secondly, the progress to reduce wasting and stunting in children under-5 has 
not been enough and more work needs to be done if Ethiopia is to achieve the

two parallel groups, and cluster assignment by groups of villages. The cohort of 
mother-child dyads will be followed-up over the intervention period of 
approximately 24 months, starting from recruitment to 18 months of the child's 
age. The study will take place in north-central Bangladesh. The primary trial 
outcome will be the percentage of stunted children at 18 m as measured in follow

subsample from the 2011 Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey, a nationally

71.7% of specimens (LOD = 0.5 pg/mg albumin). Unadjusted GM AFB1-lys (pg/mg 
albumin) was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.21-1.47). Serum AFB1-lys was higher in males (GM: 
1.57; 95% CI: 1.38-1.80) vs. females (GM: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.97-1.30) (P = .0019),

mothers and infants. We examined levels of eight mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1 , B2 , 
G1 , G2 , M1 , M2 ; Ochratoxin A, B) in 100 breast milk samples (infants 2-4 
months) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1 ), fumonisin B1 (FB1 ) and deoxynivalenol (DON) 
were detected in several food items (n = 298) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays. We report novel data on the presence of mycotoxins in breast milk 
samples from India. Whereas breast milk concentrations (AFM1 median: 13.7; 
range: 3.9-1200 ng/L) remain low, AFM1 was detected above regulatory limits in 
27% of animal milk samples. Additionally, 41% of infants were above provisional 
maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) limits for AFM1 due to consumption of 
breast milk (mean: 3.04, range: 0.26-80.7 ng kg-1 bw day-1 ). Maternal 
consumption of breads (p < 0.05) was associated with breast milk AFM1 exposure. 
AFB1 (μg/kg) was detected in dried red chilies (15.7; 0-302.3), flour (3.13; 
0-214.9), groundnuts (0; 0-249.1), maize (56.0; 0-836.7), pearl millet (1.85;

child growth standard which was developed using precise measurements. However, 
it is unlikely that large scale surveys maintain the same level of rigour and 
precision when measuring the height of children. The population measure of 
stunting in children is sensitive to over-dispersion, and the high prevalence of 
stunting observed in surveys in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) could 
partly be due to lower measurement precison.
OBJECTIVES: To quantify the incongruence in the dispersion of height-for-age in 
national surveys of < 5 y children, in relation to the standard WHO Multicenter 
Growth Reference Study (MGRS), and propose a measure of uncertainty in 
population measures of stunting.
METHODS: An uncertainty factor was proposed and measured from the observed 
incongruence in dispersion of the height-for-age of < 5 y children in the MGRS 
against carefully matched populations from the Demographic Health Survey of 17 
countries ('test datasets', based on the availability of data). This also 
allowed for the determination of uncertainty-corrected prevalence of stunting 
(height-for-age Z score < - 2) in < 5 y children.
RESULTS: The uncertainty factor was estimated for 17 LMICs. This ranged from 0.9 
to 2.1 for Peru and Egypt respectively (reference value 1). As an explicit 
country example, the dispersion of height-for-age in the Indian National Family 
Health Survey-4 test dataset was 39% higher than the MGRS study, with an 
uncertainty factor of 1.39. From this, the uncertainty-adjusted Indian national 
stunting prevalence estimate reduced to 18.7% from the unadjusted estimate of 
36.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a robust statistical method to estimate 
uncertainty in stunting prevalence estimates due to incongruent dispersions of 
height measured in national surveys for children < 5 years in relation to the 
WHO height-for-age standard. The uncertainty is partly due to population 
heterogeneity, but also due to measurement precision, and calls for better 
quality in these measurements.",

global human displacement, Ethiopia has the highest number of newly displaced 
people forced to flee their homes. Displaced people have arrived in other 
regions, sometimes leading to conflict. Several regions in Ethiopia experience 
on-going ethnic tensions and violence between tribes, which leaves smallholder 
farmers suspicious of any outside activities in their locale, assuming other 
ethnic groups may harm them. Changes in the central Ethiopian government have 
also led to suspicion of non-local agencies. The Campylobacter Genomics and 
Enteric Dysfunction (CAGED) research project's objective is to improve the 
incomes, livelihoods and nutrition of smallholder farmers and was conducted 
during this period of increasing violence. The project aims to assess the impact 
of reducing exposure to chicken excreta on young children's gut health and 
growth. This paper does not report empirical findings from CAGED, but is part of 
a series that aims to identify challenges in humanitarian research and reports 
on mitigation strategies during this research.
DISCUSSION: This research is important to determine whether Campylobacter 
infection in chicken's contributes to illness and stunting in children. However, 
violence against other researchers in different parts of Ethiopia led to 
mistrust and lack of engagement by the community with the researchers. Some 
reactions were so hostile that the team was fearful about returning to some 
households. As a result, the team designed strategies to respond, including 
establishing two types of community advisory boards. One used pre-existing 
village elder structures and another was composed of village youth. Data 
collection team members received training in principles of ethics, consent, and 
crisis management, and were provided on-going support from local and 
international principal investigators and the study's ethics advisor.
CONCLUSION: The hostility and mistrust led to fear among the data collectors. 
These and the resulting strategies to address them resulted in delays for the 
research. However, the interventions taken resulted in successful completion of 
the field activities. Moreover, the lessons learned from this project are 
already being implemented with other projects being conducted in various parts 
of Ethiopia.",

prevalence of stunting in children aged under two has reduced by only 6% since 
2004. After children reach 2 years of age, the consequences of stunting become 
almost irreversible. This paper seeks to examine and analyze the determinants 
associated with stunting during the first 1,000 days of life in Bangladesh to 
assist in developing evidence-based interventions in Bangladesh. A literature 
review was conducted comprehensively on all relevant peer-reviewed and gray 
literature of studies conducted in Bangladesh. The existing literature was 
searched and examined using the World Health Organization (WHO) conceptual 
framework for stunting. Evidence indicates that low maternal weight, lack of 
maternal education, severe food insecurity, lack of access to suitable 
nutrition, nonexclusive breastfeeding, pathogen-specific diarrhea, and low 
weight and height at birth are associated with early childhood stunting in 
Bangladesh. The relation of the quality of drinking water with stunting is not 
clear in Bangladesh. Literature about the association between stunting and 
determinants such as the political economy, education systems, and agriculture 
and food systems is not found. This synthesis shows that the factors of stunting 
are multifaceted. As such, a multi-sectoral approach is essential in Bangladesh, 
employing evidence-based interventions to address the determinants that 
contribute to the risk of stunting to achieve the global nutrition target by

chronic diarrhea, foodborne outbreaks, infections of the immunocompromised, and 
growth stunting in children in developing nations. There is no vaccine and 
resistance to antibiotics is rising. Unlike related E. coli pathotypes that are 
often associated with acute bouts of infection, EAEC is associated with 
persistent diarrhea and subclinical long-term colonization. Several secreted 
virulence factors have been associated with EAEC pathogenesis and linked to 
disease in humans, less certain are the molecular drivers of adherence to the 
intestinal mucosa. We previously established human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) 
as a model system to study host-EAEC interactions and aggregative adherence 
fimbriae A (AafA) as a major driver of EAEC adherence to HIEs. Here, we report a 
large-scale assessment of the host response to EAEC adherence from all four 
segments of the intestine across at least three donor lines for five E. coli 
pathotypes. The data demonstrate that the host response in the duodenum is 
driven largely by the infecting pathotype, whereas the response in the colon 
diverges in a patient-specific manner. Major pathways altered in gene expression 
in each of the four enteroid segments differed dramatically, with responses 
observed for inflammation, apoptosis and an overwhelming response to different 
mucin genes. In particular, EAEC both associated with large mucus droplets and 
specific mucins at the epithelial surface, binding that was ameliorated when 
mucins were removed, a process dependent on AafA. Pan-screening for glycans for 
binding to purified AafA identified the human ligand as heparan sulfate 
proteoglycans (HSPGs). Removal of HSPG abrogated EAEC association with HIEs. 
These results may mean that the human intestine responds remarkably different to 
distinct pathobionts that is dependent on the both the individual and intestinal 
segment in question, and uncover a major role for surface heparan sulfate

among children aged 6-60 months.
METHODS: This is a case-control and cross-sectional study between 40 stunting 
cases and 40 controls. Data on possible risk factors associated with stunting 
were obtained through direct interviews and using a questionnaire. Examination 
of vitamin D, zinc, albumin, and ferritin levels was performed on both groups. 
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Co., 
Armonk, NY, USA) to determine risk factors for stunting and to assess the 
relationship between nutritional levels and stunting.
RESULTS: The incidence of stunting was highest in children aged 12-36 months. 
Children with low weight and very low weight for age comprised of 55% and 22.5%, 
respectively, of the study participants. The highest mother's educational level 
was junior high school (40%). History of low birth weight (LBW) was more 
commonly observed in the stunting group than that in the control group (25.0% 
and 7.5%, respectively; p=0.034, odds ratio, 0.310 [95% confidence interval, 
0.122-0.789]). Approximately 7.5% of cases had premature birth. Exclusive breast 
feeding was found to be not correlated with stunting. The mean zinc level in the 
stunting group was 34.17 ng/mL, which was different from that in the control 
group (50.83 ng/mL) (p=0.023). Blood ferritin, vitamin D, albumin, and calcium 
levels were not strongly correlated with stunting.
CONCLUSION: LBW is the main risk factor contributing to stunting and is strongly 
associated with low zinc level.",

and rates of linear growth stunting in children under 5 y of age, although rates 
still remain high in many regions. Policies, programs, and interventions 
supporting maternal and child health and nutrition have the potential to improve 
child growth and development.
OBJECTIVE: This article synthesizes the available global evidence on the drivers 
of national declines in stunting prevalence and compares the relative effect of 
major drivers of stunting decline between countries.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published peer-reviewed and gray 
literature analyzing the relation between changes in key determinants of child 
linear growth and contemporaneous changes in linear growth outcomes over time.
RESULTS: Among the basic determinants of stunting assessed within 
regression-decomposition analyses, improvement in asset index score was a 
consistent and strong driver of improved linear growth outcomes. Increased 
parental education was also a strong predictor of improved child growth. Of the 
underlying determinants of stunting, reduced rates of open defecation, improved 
sanitation infrastructure, and improved access to key maternal health services, 
including optimal antenatal care and delivery in a health facility or with a 
skilled birth attendant, all accounted for substantially improved child growth, 
although the magnitude of variation explained by each differed substantially 
between countries. At the immediate level, changes in several maternal 
characteristics predicted modest stunting reductions, including parity, 
interpregnancy interval, and maternal height.
CONCLUSIONS: Unique sets of stunting determinants predicted stunting reduction 
within countries that have reduced stunting. Several common drivers emerge at 
the basic, underlying, and immediate levels, including improvements in maternal 
and paternal education, household socioeconomic status, sanitation conditions, 
maternal health services access, and family planning. Further data collection 
and in-depth mixed-methods research are required to strengthen recommendations 
for those countries where the stunting burden remains unacceptably high.",

The prevalence of stunting in central rural Malawi is ~50%, which prompted a multipronged nutrition program in 1 district from 2014 to 2016. The program distributed a daily, fortified, small-quantity lipid-based nutritional supplement, providing 110 kcal and 2.6 g of protein to children aged 623 mo, and behavior change messages around optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and water, sanitation, and hygiene.

Objectives:
Our objective was to perform an impact evaluation of the program using a neighboring district as comparison.

Methods:
Using a quasi-experimental study design, with cross-sectional baseline (JanuaryMarch, 2014; n = 2404)and endline (JanuaryMarch, 2017; n = 2453) surveys, we evaluated the program's impact using a neighboring district as comparison. Impact on stunting was estimated using propensity score weighted difference-in-differences regression analyses to account for baseline differences between districts.

Results:
No differences in mean length-for-age z-score or prevalence of stunting were found at endline. However,mean weight, weight-for-length z-score, and mid-upper arm circumference were higher at endline by 150 g, 0.22, and 0.19 cm, respectively, in the program compared with the comparison district (all P < 0.05). Weekly reports of high fever and malaria were also lower by 6.4 and 4.7 percentage points, respectively, in the program compared with the comparison district (both P < 0.05). There was no impact on anemia. Children's dietary diversity score improved by 0.17,and caregivers' infant and young child feeding and hand-washing practices improved by 811%in the program compared with the comparison district (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions:
An impact evaluation of a comprehensive nutrition program in rural Malawi demonstrated benefit for child ponderal growth and health, improved maternal IYCF and hand-washing practices, but a reduction in stunting prevalence was not observed.",

Armed conflict is a significant social determinant of child health with nuanced effects. There is a dearth of knowledge on the public health issues facing vulnerable populations in conflict-stricken areas. The objective was to determine the prevalence and determinants of moderate to severe anaemia (MdSA) and severe stunting (SS) in children ?3?years in conflict-hit Dibanda, Ekona and Muea in the Mount Cameroon area.

Methods
Haematological parameters were obtained using an automated haematology analyser while undernutrition indices standard deviation (SD) scores (z- scores), were computed based on the WHO growth reference curves for 649 children in a community based cross-sectional study in 2018. Binomial logistic regression models were used to evaluate the determinants of MdSA and SS against a set of predictor variables.

Results
Anaemia was prevalent in 84.0% (545) of the children with a majority having microcytic anaemia (59.3%). The prevalence of MdSA was 56.1% (364). Educational level of parents/caregiver (P?<? 0.001) and site (P?=?0.043) had a significant negative effect on the occurrence of MdSA. Stunting, underweight and wasting occurred in 31.3, 13.1 and 6.3% of the children, respectively. Overall, SS was prevalent in 17.1% (111) of the children. The age groups (0.11.0?year, P?=?0.042 and 1.12.0?years, P?=?0.008), educational levels (no formal education, P?<? 0.001 and primary education P?=?0.028) and SS (P?=?0.035) were significant determinants of MdSA while MdSA (P?=?0.035) was the only significant determinant of SS. On the contrary, age group 0.11?year (OR?=?0.56, P?=?0.043) and site (Dibanda, OR?=?0.29, P?=?0.001) demonstrated a significant protective effect against SS.

Conclusions
Moderate to severe anaemia, severe stunting and wasting especially in children not breastfed at all are public health challenges in the conflict-hit area. There is a need for targeted intervention to control anaemia as well as increased awareness of exclusive breast feeding in conflict-hit areas to limit the burden of wasting and stunting.",

years has remained above global critical levels over the past two decades, with 
the stunting rate being 40.2% in 2018. Children living in rural areas and in the 
poorest households suffer the most from stunting across the country-43.2% in 
rural areas and 51.4% in the lowest wealth quintile. As a continuing public 
health concern, it is essential that stunting prevention is a national priority 
in order to ensure human capital development, especially among the poorest 
households.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of a 
medium quantity of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) combined with 
unconditional cash transfers and social and behavior change communication (SBCC) 
on reduction of stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months.
METHODS: A 5-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the 
district of Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab, Pakistan. The intervention packages will 
be (1) cash only, (2) cash with LNS, (3) cash with SBCC, and (4) cash with SBCC 
and LNS. The control arm will receive routine standard of care. We will enroll 
children at 6 months of age and follow up on a monthly basis up to 24 months of 
age. A total of 2000 children, 400 in each arm, will be enrolled to detect a 20% 
reduction in the prevalence of stunting among children aged 24 months. Length, 
weight, food intake, compliance to interventions, morbidities, and other 
relevant data will be collected at enrollment and on a monthly basis over the 
period of 18 months. The process evaluation will assess acceptability of the 
interventions and potential barriers to implementation through focus group 
discussions and in-depth interviews with the target population and relevant 
stakeholders. Furthermore, a cost analysis will be conducted to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of each intervention package.
RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Aga 
Khan University in Pakistan on January 4, 2017. Data collection began in May 
2017 and was completed in July 2019. Data analyses are yet to be completed. This 
study will explore the effectiveness of intervention packages comprised of cash 
transfers from Benazir Income Support Programme with or without additional LNS 
and SBCC in preventing childhood stunting. We expect the results to be published 
in peer-reviewed journals by autumn of 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this trial will provide robust evidence as to which 
intervention packages can have significant effects on linear growth of children 
and design effective intervention packages to prevent stunting in children aged 
6 to 23 months.

barrier to achieve optimal cognitive development, child growth and ability to 
reach full potential. Almost half of children under-five years of age are 
stunted in the province of Sindh, Pakistan.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
the provision of lipid-based nutrient supplement-medium-quantity (LNS-MQ) known 
as Wawamum will result in a 10% reduction in risk of being stunted at the age of 
24 months in the intervention group compared with the control group.
DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in Thatta and 
Sujawal districts of Sindh province, Pakistan. A total of 870 (419 in 
intervention; 451 in control) children between 6-18 months old were enrolled in 
the study. The unit of randomization was union council and considered as a 
cluster. A total of 12 clusters, 6 in each study group were randomly assigned to 
intervention and control group. All children received standard government health 
services, while children in the intervention group also received 50 grams/day of 
Wawamum.
RESULTS: Children who received Wawamum were found to have a significantly 
reduced risk of stunting (RR = 0.91, 95% CI; 0.88-0.94, p<0.001) and wasting (RR 
= 0.78, 95% CI; 0.67-0.92, p = 0.004) as compared to children who received the 
standard government health services. There was no evidence of a reduction in the 
risk of underweight (RR = 0.94, 95% CI; 0.85-1.04, p = 0.235) in the 
intervention group compared to the control group. Statistically significant 
reduction in anaemia in the intervention group was also found as compared to the 
control group (RR = 0.97, 95% CI; 0.94-0.99, p = 0.042). The subgroup analysis 
by age, showed intervention effect is significant in reduction of risk of 
stunting in younger children of aged 6-12 month (RR = 0.83, 95% CI; 0.81-0.86, p 
= <0.001) and their older peers aged 13-18 month- (RR = 0.90, 95% CI; 0.83-0.97, 
p = 0.008). The mean compliance of Wawamum was 60% among children.
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that the provision of Wawamum to children 6-23 
months of age is effective in reducing the risk of stunting, wasting and 
anaemia. This approach should be scaled up among the most food insecure 
areas/households with a high prevalence of stunting to achieve positive outcomes 
for nutrition and health. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as

reducing child stunting prevalence by 17.9% from 1992 to 2017.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic in-depth assessment 
of factors at the national, community, household, and individual levels to 
determine the key enablers of Senegal's success in reducing stunting in children 
<5 y old between 1992/93 and 2017.
METHODS: A mixed methods approach was implemented, comprising quantitative data 
analysis, a systematic literature review, creation of a timeline of 
nutrition-related programs, and qualitative interviews with national and 
regional stakeholders and mothers in communities. Demographic and Health Surveys 
and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys were used to explore stunting 
inequalities and factors related to the change in height-for-age z-score (HAZ) 
using difference-in-difference linear regression and the Oaxaca-Blinder 
decomposition method.
RESULTS: Population-wide gains in average child HAZ and stunting prevalence have 
occurred from 1992/93 to 2017. Stunting prevalence reduction varied by 
geographical region and prevalence gaps were reduced slightly between wealth 
quintiles, maternal education groups, and urban compared with rural residence. 
Statistical determinants of change included improvements in maternal and newborn 
health (27.8%), economic improvement (19.5%), increases in parental education 
(14.9%), and better piped water access (8.1%). Key effective nutrition programs 
used a community-based approach, including the Community Nutrition Program and 
the Nutrition Enhancement Program. Stakeholders felt sustained political will 
and multisectoral collaboration along with improvements in poverty, women's 
education, hygiene practices, and accessibility to health services at the 
community level reduced the burden of stunting.
CONCLUSIONS: Senegal's success in the stunting decline is largely attributed to 
the country's political stability, the government's prioritization of nutrition 
and execution of nutrition efforts using a multisectoral approach, improvements 
in the availability of health services and maternal education, access to piped 
water and sanitation facilities, and poverty reduction. Further efforts in the 
health, water and sanitation, and agriculture sectors will support continued 
success.",

and agricultural products. Growth retardation in children caused by extensive 
DON pollution has become a global problem that cannot be ignored. Previous 
studies have shown that DON causes stunting in children through intestinal 
dysfunction, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis disorder and peptide YY 
(PYY). Galanin-like peptide (GALP) is an important growth regulator, but its 
role in DON-induced growth retardation is unclear. In this study, we report the 
important role of GALP during DON-induced growth inhibition in the rat pituitary 
tumour cell line GH3. DON was found to increase the expression of GALP through 
hypomethylationin the promoter region of the GALP gene and upregulate the 
expression of proinflammatory factors, while downregulate the expression of 
growth hormone (GH). Furthermore, GALP overexpression promoted proinflammatory 
cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-11 and IL-6, and further reduced cell 
viability and cell proliferation, while the inhibitory effect of GALP was the 
opposite. The expression of GALP and insulin like growth factor binding protein 
acid labile subunit (IGFALS) showed the opposite trend, which was the potential 
reason for the regulation of cell proliferation by GALP. In addition, GALP has 
anti-apoptotic effects, which could not eliminate the inflammatory damage of 
cells, thus aggravating cell growth inhibition. The present findings provide new 
mechanistic insights into the toxicity of DON-induced growth retardation and 
suggest a therapeutic potential of GALP in DON-related diseases.",

of undernutrition, with the opposite end of the spectrum (overnutrition) being 
evidenced in the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity, demonstrated to be 
associated with chronic metabolic diseases in adulthood. Targeting childhood 
malnutrition is a potential interventional strategy to prevent non-communicable 
diseases amongst adults. As the prevalence of malnutrition (undernutrition and 
overnutrition) in rural, northern KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, is 
largely unknown, this study aimed to determine the baseline nutritional status 
of children attending primary healthcare facilities within the Bethesda Hospital 
catchment area.
METHODS: This quantitative, cross-sectional study included children aged 6 weeks 
to 19 years, attending any primary healthcare clinics for over a 3 months 
period. Anthropometric measurements were obtained to categorise the children 
according to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) nutritional classifications.
RESULTS: Stunting in children aged less than 5 years was found to be lower (14%) 
than nationally representative studies (27%); however, 14.4% of the infants aged 
6 weeks to 5 months were overweight, increasing to 32.3% in those aged 14-19 
years. Males in the 6-weeks to 5-month age group were more likely to be 
overweight/obese and stunted than females in the same age group.
CONCLUSION: Undernutrition is showing a downward trend, which is a testament to 
initiatives to reduce food insecurity amongst the poor. However, the emerging 
upward trend of overweight/obesity in children of all ages, indicates the need 
to have a national discussion on over- and undernutrition, its causes and 
implications.",

communities). The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection increased in 
both the impacted and comparison communities between 2011 and 2019 but remained 
consistently lower in the impacted communities. Stunting in children < 5 years 
and the prevalence of intestinal parasite infections in children aged 9-14 years 
mostly decreased. In women of reproductive age, selected health indicators 
(i.e., anaemia, syphilis, underweight and place of delivery) either remained 
stable or improved. Impacted communities generally showed better health outcomes 
than comparison communities, suggesting that the health interventions 
implemented by the project as a consequence of the HIA have mitigated potential 
negative effects and enhanced positive effects. Caution is indicated to avoid 
promotion of health inequalities within and beyond the project area.",

causing rot and producing fumonisin mycotoxins during infection. Ingestion of 
fumonisin-contaminated corn causes underperformance and even fatal toxicity in 
livestock and is associated with neural tube birth defects, growth stunting in 
children, and some cancers. StuA, an APSES-class transcription factor, is a 
major developmental transcriptional regulator in fungi. It has been shown to 
regulate crucial developmental processes, such as sporulation, virulence, and 
mycotoxin synthesis among others. In this study, the role of FvSTUA in F. 
verticillioides was examined by characterizing ∆FvstuA deletion mutants 
functionally and transcriptomally. The deletion mutants exhibited reduced 
vegetative growth, stunted aerial hyphae, and significant reductions in 
microconidiation. Macroconidiation and hydrophobicity of the deletion strains 
were reduced as well. Additionally, fumonisin production and virulence of the 
deletion mutants were greatly reduced. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 
downregulation of expression of several genes in the fumonisin and fusarin C 
biosynthetic clusters and differential expression of genes involved in 
conidiation and virulence. Nuclear localization of FvSTUA supported its likely 
function as a transcription factor. Together, our results indicate that FvSTUA 
plays a global role in transcriptional regulation in F. verticillioides 
influencing morphogenesis, toxin production, and virulence.",

the infant but function as prebiotics for bacterial strains associated with 
numerous benefits. Considering the broad variety of beneficial effects of HMOs,

with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. This approach 
identified over 100 different glycoforms and showed a wide diversity of milk

nonmodified HMOs. We observed that these samples contain on average 80 HMOs, 
with the highest permethylated masses detected being >5000 mass units. Here we 
report an easily implemented method developed for the separation, 
characterization and relative quantitation of large arrays of HMOs, including 
higher molecular weight sialylated HMOs. Our ultimate goal is to create a 
simple, high-throughput method, which can be used for full characterization of

threat to child development in developing countries. It is associated with 
micronutrient deficiency arising from poor diets fed to children under 5 years. 
Food fortification is amongst the interventions focused at reducing the 
incidence of stunting in children under 5 years.
METHODS: Using a large-scale household data from Zimbabwe, we investigated the 
gender-based importance of household adoption of food fortification on the 
proportion of stunted children in the household. We employed propensity score 
matching to mitigate self-selection bias associated with household adoption of 
food fortification.
RESULTS: We offer three major findings. Firstly, we find statistically weak 
evidence that female headed households are more likely to adopt food 
fortification than their male counterparts. Secondly, food fortification reduces 
the proportion of stunted children in the household. Finally, in comparison to 
non-adopters, female headed households that adopt food fortification are more 
able to reduce the proportion of stunted children in their households than their 
male counterparts.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the need for policy makers to actively promote 
food fortification, as such interventions are likely to contribute to the 
reduction of stunting and to involve men in fortification interventions to 
improve on their knowledge and appreciation of fortified foods and the 
associated benefits.",

undernutrition that may be ameliorated by the provision of high-quality foods 
that provide protein and micronutrients. Addressing this problem in lower social 
economic environments requires, in part, affordable and scalable food-based 
solutions with efficacious food products. Towards this end, 
biochemical/metabolic indicators for fast-throughput screening of foods and 
their components are desired. A highly acceptable and economical 
micronutrient-fortified food product with different levels of legume protein was 
provided to stunted Indian children for one month, to determine change in their 
linear growth and explore associated biochemical, metabolomic and microbiome 
indicators.
METHODS: A randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted with 100 stunted 
children (6-10 years of age) to elucidate metabolic and microbiome-based 
biomarkers associated with linear growth. They were randomized into 4 groups 
receiving 6, 8, 10 or 12 g of legume-based protein for one month. Anthropometry, 
blood biochemistry, aminoacidomics, acylcarnitomics and fecal microbiome were 
measured before and after feeding.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between groups in height, 
height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) or BMI-for-age Z-score (BAZ); however, 38 serum 
metabolites were altered significantly (Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.1) in response 
to the interventions. IGF-1 (Insulin like Growth Factor-1) was positively 
(ρ > 0.2, P = 0.02), while serine and ornithine (ρ < -0.2, P = 0.08) were 
negatively associated with change in height. Leucine, isoleucine and valine 
positively correlated (P = 0.011, 0.023 and 0.007 respectively) with change in 
BAZ. Three Operational Taxonomic Units belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes 
(VIP score > 1.5) were significantly correlated with change in height.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot trial, a number of fasting serum metabolomic and 
fecal microbiome signatures were associated with linear growth after a 
short-term dietary intervention. The alterations of these markers should be 
validated in long-term dietary intervention trials as potential screening 
indicators towards the development of food products that favor growth. This 
trial was registered at www.ctri.nic.in as CTRI/2016/12/007564.",

indicator of chronic malnutrition. It develops mainly as a result of prolonged 
food deprivation or a chronic disease or illness. Unintended pregnancies and 
unplanned births are among the psychological factors that negatively affect the 
nutritional status of children. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the 
effects of unintended pregnancies and other family and child characteristics on 
the nutritional status of children under 5 years old.
METHODS: A community-based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 302 
children (151 cases and 151 controls) 6-59 months old in Wonago town, Gedeo 
Zone, Southern Ethiopia. The cases were stunted children and the controls were 
non-stunted children in the study area. The cases were randomly selected from 
among the stunted children, and the controls were randomly selected from among 
the non-stunted children. The descriptive characteristics of the respondents 
were compared using the chi-squared test, and a multivariable logistic 
regression was used to assess the effects of an unintended pregnancy on 
stunting, after controlling for the other variables, with a p value of 0.05.
RESULTS: The result revealed that unintended pregnancy is found to be among 
predictors of stunting where children from unintended pregnancy were about three 
times more likely to be stunted [AOR: 2.62, CI: (1.26, 5.45)]. The other 
predictors identified in this study were educational status of the father, 
wealth index of the household and daily meal frequency. From the finding, 
children from illiterate fathers [AOR: 3.43, CI: (1.04, 11.29)], children from 
poorer household economic status [AOR: 2.32, CI: (1.20, 4.49)] and children whom 
their daily meal frequency is below the recommended number of feeding [AOR: 
4.50, CI: (1.31, 15.49)] were found to be more stunted.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, the children born from 
unintended pregnancies exhibited a significantly higher risk of stunting. 
Therefore, preventing unintended pregnancy could play a great role in decreasing 
the risk of stunting in children.",

explore the association between early-onset persistent stunting in children and 
cognitive development at 5 years of age, and to identify the factors associated 
with early-onset stunting.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Children from the MAL-ED cohort study were followed from 
birth to 5 years of age in six LMICs. The Wechsler Preschool Primary Scales of 
Intelligence (WPPSI) was used to assess cognitive abilities (fluid reasoning) at 
5 years and was adapted for each culture. Stunting was categorized as 
early-onset persistent (first stunted at 1-6 months and persisting at 60 
months), early-onset recovered (first stunted at 1-6 months and not stunted at 
60 months), late-onset persistent (first stunted at 7-24 months and persisting 
at 60 months), late-onset recovered (first stunted at 7-24 months and not 
stunted at 60 months), and never (never stunted). Mixed effects linear models 
were used to estimate the relationship between stunting status and cognitive 
development. Children with early-onset persistent stunting had significantly 
lower cognitive scores (-2.10 (95% CI: -3.85, -0.35)) compared with those who 
were never stunted. Transferrin receptor (TfR) was also negatively associated 
with cognitive development (-0.31 (95% CI: -0.49, -0.13)), while the HOME

metabolize fucose. We also identify a new Campylobacter species coinfecting 
these infants with a high prevalence in five of the seven countries in

among the most important child health indicators that cause concerns all over 
the world. Based on international literature findings, birth weight, stunting 
and overweight/obesity of children may differ according to the various 
sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. In addition, migration status of 
women and their children (within urban areas, within rural areas, urban to rural 
and rural to urban) may influence the birth outcomes and health status of 
children aged less than 5 years. The aim of this study is to determine the 
distribution of internal migration and the sociodemographic and socioeconomic 
factors on birth weight, stunting and overweight/obesity in children aged less 
than 5 years in Turkey. Another purpose of this study is to investigate the 
course of birth weight, stunting and overweight/obesity in children between 1993 
and 2013 in Turkey.
METHODS: The source of data for this study was the nationally representative 
five Turkey Demographic and Health Surveys (1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 TNSA). 
Surveys were conducted by Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies. 
Logistic regression analysis was used in order to determine the impact of 
migration status, sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors on birth weight, 
stunting and overweight/obesity of children.
RESULTS: Compared to children living in urban areas, inadequate birth weight was 
found to be higher in children living in rual areas and in children who had 
migrated from urban areas to rural areas. Stunting was found to be higher in 
rural areas and urban to rural areas compared to urban areas. Unlike birth 
weight and stunting in children, overweight/obesity was higher in children 
living in urban areas compared to children living in rural areas. Moreover, it 
was revealed that sociodemographic factors (maternal education, birth order, 
receiving prenatal care, age, gender) and socioeconomic factors (residential 
area and childhood residential area) affected the birth weight, stunting and 
overweight/obesity of children in this study.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for policymakers to take steps to overcome the 
regional disparities that create disadvantages for children aged less than 5 
years in disadvantaged areas.",

healthy growth and development, as well as a strong immune system and good 
cognitive development. The period from conception to infancy is especially vital 
for optimal physical growth, health and development. In this study we examined 
the influence of household structure on stunting in children <5 yrs of age in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries.
METHODS: Demographic and Health Survey data from birth histories in 35 SSA 
countries were used in this study. The total sample of children born within the 
5 yrs before the surveys (2008 and 2018) was 384 928. Children whose 
height-for-age z-score throughout was <-2 SDs from the median of the WHO 
reference population were considered stunted. Percentages and χ2 tests were used 
to explore prevalence and bivariate associations of stunting. In addition, a 
multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to stunted children. All 
statistical tests were conducted at a p<0.05 level of significance.
RESULTS: More than one-third of children in SSA countries were reportedly 
stunted. The leading countries include Burundi (55.9%), Madagascar (50.1%), 
Niger (43.9%) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (42.7%). The percentage 
of stunted children was higher among males than females and among rural children 
than their urban counterparts in SSA countries. Children from polygamous 
families and from mothers who had been in multiple unions had a 5% increase in 
stunting compared with children from monogamous families and mothers who had 
only one union (AOR 1.05 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.09]). Furthermore, rural children 
were 1.23 times as likely to be stunted compared with urban children (AOR 1.23 
[95% CI 1.16 to 1.29]). Children having a <24-mo preceding birth interval were 
1.32 times as likely to be stunted compared with first births (AOR 1.32 [95% CI 
1.26 to 1.38]). In addition, there was a 2% increase in stunted children for 
every unit increase in the age (mo) of children (AOR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01 to 
1.02]). Multiple-birth children were 2.09 times as likely to be stunted compared 
with a singleton (AOR 2.09 [95% CI 1.91 to 2.28]).
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that more than one-third of children were 
stunted in SSA countries. Risk factors for childhood stunting were also 
identified. Effective interventions targeting factors associated with childhood 
stunting, such as maternal education, advanced maternal age, male sex, child's 
age, longer birth interval, multiple-birth polygamy, improved household wealth 
and history of mothers' involvement in multiple unions, are required to reduce 
childhood stunting in the region.",

sociodemographic characteristics associated to stunting in children under five 
years old, living on locali- ties with less than 100 000 inhabitants in Mexico 
in 2012 and 2018.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Low weight, stunting and wasting prevalences were 
calculated in children under 5y according to WHO Growth Reference. A comparison 
of stunting by sociodemographic and diet diversity variables is presented. 
Multi-variated logistic models between chronic malnutrition and sociodemographic 
variables were calculated.
RESULTS: In 2018, 4.4% of the individuals suffered low weight, 14.9% stunting 
and 1.5 % wasting. Stunting was greater in indigenous households (24.5%), 
households from the lower socioeconomic-index tertile (17.5%), and households 
with moderated/severe food insecurity (15.3%). Stunting was positively 
associated with indigenous condition; on the other hand a highly diverse diet 
resulted to be a protective factor against it.

We sought to develop and externally validate an early life predictive model that could be applied in infancy to accurately predict risk of stunting in preschool children.

Methods: We conducted two separate prospective cohort studies in Vietnam that intensively monitored children from early pregnancy until 3 years of age. They included 1168 and 475 live-born infants for model development and validation, respectively. Logistic regression on child stunting at 3 years of age was performed for model development, and the predicted probabilities for stunting were used to evaluate the performance of this model in the validation data set.

Results: Stunting prevalence was 16.9% (172 of 1015) in the development data set and 16.4% (70 of 426) in the validation data set. Key predictors included in the final model were paternal and maternal height, maternal weekly weight gain during pregnancy, infant sex, gestational age at birth, and infant weight and length at 6 months of age. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the validation data set was 0.85 (95% Confidence Interval, 0.80-0.90).

Conclusion: This tool applied to infants at 6 months of age provided valid prediction of risk of stunting at 3 years of age using a readily available set of parental and infant measures. Further research is required to examine the impact of preventive measures introduced at 6 months of age on those identified as being at risk of growth faltering at 3 years of age.",

deaths due to stunting are associated with inappropriate feeding practices that 
occur in the first 5 years of life. This study aimed at determining the risk 
factors for stunting in children under 5 years of age in the Eastern and Western 
provinces of Rwanda.
METHOD: Cross-sectional study using secondary data from Rwanda Demographic 
Health Survey 2014/2015.
RESULTS: Stunting was highly prevalent in eastern province compared to Western 
province. It was also highly prevalent in rural area in both provinces. Results 
indicated a significant association between maternal education and stunting 
(=6.868; p=0.001), maternal age group (=15.44; p=0.017), maternal occupation 
(=30.012; p=0.000), wealth index (=14.327; p=0.006), sex of child (=2.91; 
p=0.008) and giving child fortified food (=4.256; p=0.039). Results indicated 
that antenatal care visits were significantly associated with stunting (=6.653; 
p=0.01). Sharing a toilet was significantly associated with stunting (=25.88; 
p=0.000). Multiple logistic regression indicated that the gender of child 
[OR=1.08; 95% CI (1.057-1.093), p=0.008], household wealth index [OR=0.386; 95% 
CI (0.357-0.414)] and breastfeeding [OR=0.02; 95% CI (0.004-0.036), p=0.013]

CONCLUSION: Immediate and appropriate interventions targeted at community 
management of acute malnutrition and stunting are needed to manage the 
associated morbidity and mortality. Strengthening the health system for 
improving child health through prioritizing maternal and child by addressing 
poverty and increase food access is mostly needed. These tactics yield more

infected patients may have no overt symptoms or suffer from severe cramps, 
diarrhea, nausea and even urticaria. Recently, post-infectious irritable bowel 
syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome have been identified as long-term sequelae 
of giardiasis. Frequently, recurrent and chronic Giardia infection is considered 
a major contributor to stunting in children from low and middle income 
countries. Perhaps the most unusual outcome of infection with Giardia is the 
apparent reduced risk of developing moderate-to-severe diarrhea due to other 
enteric infections which has been noted in several recent studies. The goal of 
understanding immune responses against Giardia is therefore to identify 
protective mechanisms which could become targets for vaccine development, but 
also to identify mechanisms whereby infections lead to these other diverse 
outcomes. Giardia induces a robust adaptive immune response in both humans and 
animals. It has been known for many years that there is production of large 
amounts of parasite-specific IgA following infection and that CD4+ T cell 
responses contribute to this IgA production and control of the infection. In the 
past decade, there have been advances in our understanding of the non-antibody 
effector mechanisms used by the host to fight Giardia infections, in particular 
the importance of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 in orchestrating these 
responses. There have also been major advances in understanding how the innate 
response to Giardia infection is initiated and how it contributes to the 
development of adaptive immunity. Finally, there here have been significant 
increases in our knowledge of how the resident microbial community influences 
the immune response and how these responses contribute to the development of 
some of the symptoms of giardiasis. In this article, we will focus on data 
generated in the last 10 years and how it has advanced our knowledge about this 
important parasitic disease.",

is a renewed commitment of tackling the varied challenges of undernutrition, 
particularly stunting (SDG 2.2). Health equity is also a priority in the SDG 
agenda and there is an urgent need for disaggregated analyses to identify 
disadvantaged subgroups. We compared time trends in socioeconomic inequalities 
obtained through stratification by wealth quintiles and deciles for stunting 
prevalence.
METHODS: We used 37 representative Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple 
Indicator Cluster surveys from nine Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries 
conducted between 1996 and 2016. Stunting in children under-5 years was assessed 
according to the 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards and stratified by wealth 
quintiles and deciles. Within-country socioeconomic inequalities were measured 
through concentration index (CIX) and slope index of inequality (SII). We used 
variance-weighted least squares regression to estimate annual changes.
RESULTS: Eight out of nine countries showed a statistical evidence of reduction 
in stunting prevalence over time. Differences between extreme deciles were 
larger than between quintiles in most of countries and at every point in time. 
However, when using summary measures of inequality, there were no differences in 
the estimates of SII with the use of deciles and quintiles. In absolute terms, 
there was a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in Peru, Honduras, Dominican 
Republic, Belize, Suriname and Colombia. In relative terms, there was an 
increase in socioeconomic inequalities in Peru, Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras and 
Guatemala.
CONCLUSIONS: LAC countries have made substantial progress in terms of reducing 
stunting,. Nevertheless, renewed actions are needed to improve equity. 
Particularly in those countries were absolute and relative inequalities did not 
change over time such Bolivia and Guatemala. Finer breakdowns in wealth 
distribution are expected to elucidate more differences between subgroups; 
however, this approach is relevant to cast light on those subgroups that are 
still lagging behind within populations and inform equity-oriented health 
programs and practices.",

7000 children and youth under 18 years old are living with IBD in Canada, and 
600 to 650 children under 16 years old are diagnosed annually. While the peak 
age of onset of IBD is highest in the second and third decades of life, over the 
past two decades incidence has risen most rapidly in children under 5 years old. 
The treatment of children with IBD presents important challenges including 
therapeutic choices, risk of adverse events to medications, psychosocial impact 
on the child and family, increased cost of health care and the implications of 
the transition from pediatric to adult care. Despite the unique circumstances 
faced by children and their families, there is a lack of research to help 
understand the causes of the rising incidence and the best therapies for 
children with IBD. Scientific evidence-and specifically clinical trials of 
pharmaceuticals-are too often extrapolated from adult research. Health care 
providers must strive to understand the unique impact of childhood-onset IBD on 
patients and families, while researchers must expand work to address the 
important needs of this growing patient population.
HIGHLIGHTS: In 2018, there are over 7000 children and youth under 18 years old 
living with IBD in Canada, and 600 to 650 young children (under 16 years) 
diagnosed every year.The number of children in Canada living with IBD is growing 
rapidly, increasing 50% in the first decade of the 21st century.Inflammatory 
bowel disease is still rare in children younger than 5 years of age, but it is 
occurring in such young children more often than in the past.Children with IBD 
are different from adults. For example, delayed growth, extent of disease and 
difficulties encountered during adolescence are all unique to the pediatric 
experience.We must consider the psychosocial well-being of both children and 
their families, given that caring for a child with IBD can affect the global 
functioning of families.Treatment approaches in children sometimes differ from 
those in adults. However, to date, all effective therapies in adults have also 
been effective in children. There is great need for clinical trials of new 
therapies in children so that they have equal access to emerging treatments and 
optimal pediatric dosing can be established.
KEY SUMMARY POINTS: Rates of new diagnoses in children under 16 years old were 
increasing most rapidly in Ontario (increased 5.8% per year) and Quebec 
(increased 2.8% per year).Nova Scotia has the highest rate of pediatric IBD, 
with lower rates in Quebec and Ontario. However, even Ontario and Quebec have 
higher rates of pediatric IBD than most countries in the world.Inflammatory 
bowel disease is caused by the interaction between genes, environmental risk 
factors, the microbiome and the immune system. Since children experience shorter 
exposures and possibly fewer environmental risk factors, the interaction between 
these risk factors and genes may be stronger with childhood-onset IBD.The 
microbiome is mostly established in early childhood and is affected by a number 
of factors such as environment, diet, pregnancy/delivery factors and antibiotic 
use. Changing the microbiome to a healthier state may prevent the disease and 
may also be a novel therapeutic target to treat active inflammation in children 
with IBD.Children with IBD are different from adults. They are more likely to 
have extensive involvement of their intestines, especially in ulcerative 
colitis, and are at risk for growth impairment, osteoporosis, and psychosocial 
difficulties affecting their families.Children with IBD may incur more direct 
health costs for treatment of their IBD compared with adults. However, this is 
not universally true for all children because those who are very young at 
diagnosis (2 to 6 years old) may have milder disease or respond better to 
medications. This may result in decreased use of the health system, fewer 
hospitalizations and less risk of surgery than older children and 
adolescents.The choice of treatments for children with IBD may be different from 
that of adults. It is important to consider pediatric-specific disease 
considerations. Delayed growth, deficient bone development, psychosocial 
well-being of the child and family, disease extent, disease severity and risk of 
poor outcomes during transition from pediatric to adult health care are all 
important considerations when choosing the best treatment for children and 
adolescents.While the medications used are similar in children and adults with 
IBD, research to assess the effectiveness and safety of these medications in 
children (especially very young children) is sparse.Children with IBD may be 
more responsive to treatment than adults because they are more likely to have 
inflammatory (rather than stricturing) disease. Therefore, treating the 
inflammation earlier in the course of disease may prevent long-term 
complications such as strictures, obstruction, need for surgery and need for 
hospitalization.Some medications used in IBD have unique or more pronounced 
risks in children compared with adults. For example, chronic prednisone use is 
associated with growth impairment and stunting in children. Anti-TNF biologics 
are the only medications proven to improve growth in children with Crohn's 
disease and should be considered early in the course of disease in patients with 
severe IBD or those with marked growth impairment at the time of diagnosis.Some 
medications are used differently, depending on the sex of the patient. For 
example, azathioprine (with or without biologics) is associated with 
hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (and other forms of lymphoma) in adolescent and 
young adult males more often than females. Methotrexate is associated with birth 
defects in the growing fetus and therefore should be avoided in adolescent and 
adult women of child-bearing age who are not using two or more forms of birth 
control.A small group of children, typically presenting in the first two years 
of life, have single-gene mutations that cause an IBD-like bowel disease and 
also immune system dysfunction. These patients may not respond to traditional 
IBD medications and may require therapies such as bone marrow transplant. Canada 
is leading research efforts to investigate, diagnose and treat this small group 
of very vulnerable children.Inflammatory bowel disease (especially when it is 
active) can affect school attendance, social interactions, concentration and 
learning. Schools should be aware of the implications of IBD and make allowances 
for these factors in children with active inflammation and symptoms to optimize 
their chances of academic and social success.
GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS: We have limited knowledge on 
what causes IBD in children and why rates are rising most rapidly in young 
children. We must better understand the interaction between genes, the 
environment, the immune system and the microbiome in order to better prevent and 
treat the disease.Treatment for infants with IBD-like illnesses and single-gene 
mutations is limited. Future research should work towards identifying these 
children and learning how best to treat them.There are few clinical trials for 
biologics in children, and most exclude very young children. Support for such 
trials is important to understand whether the treatments work, how they should 
optimally be given and whether they are safe for young children with 
IBD.Considering the effectiveness of dietary therapies for children with Crohn's 
disease (exclusive enteral nutrition), we should work to understand how diet 
affects intestinal inflammation and the microbiome in order to better use 
dietary therapies to treat IBD.Health services researchers, health care 
providers and policy-makers should work together to understand why variation in 
the access to treatment and medical care of children with IBD exists. We must 
work together to improve the quality of care provided to these children and 
ensure they have the highest quality of care.Psychosocial implications of IBD in 
children and their families are of importance to long-term and overall 
well-being. Children with a chronic, incurable disease are at risk for mental 
illness associated with their disease. We should design interventions to improve 
the psychosocial status, mental health and quality of life of children with IBD 
and their families.While nonlive immunizations are safe for children with IBD, 
we must understand how to improve their effectiveness in children who are 
immunosuppressed. While the peak onset of IBD occurs in the second or third 
decades of life, the frequency of new diagnoses in younger children is rising 
rapidly. In Canada, the fastest growing group of newly diagnosed people with IBD 
are children aged under 5 years (termed 'very early onset [VEO] IBD). These 
young children have not been included in clinical trials of new medications, 
resulting in a lack of scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness of 
treatments in this group, and clinical experience has shown that they do not 
respond to usual medications used for the majority of children with IBD. 
Providing children with IBD with high-quality care and social support also poses 
other challenges to care providers, families and the health system. This section 
will focus on the unique challenges facing Canadian children with IBD. A

mainly produced for direct household consumption and is often contaminated with 
high levels of mycotoxins. Chronic exposure to mycotoxins is a risk factor for 
human diseases as it is implicated in the development of cancer, neural tube 
defects as well as stunting in children. Although authorities may set maximum 
levels, these regulations are not effective in subsistence farming communities. 
As maize is consumed in large quantities, exposure to mycotoxins will surpass 
safe levels even where the contamination levels are below the regulated maximum 
levels. It is clear that the lowering of exposure in these communities requires 
an integrated approach. Detailed understanding of agricultural practices, 
mycotoxin occurrence, climate change/weather patterns, human exposure and risk 
are warranted to guide adequate intervention programmes. Risk communication and 
creating awareness in affected communities are also critical. A range of 
biologically based products for control of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in 
maize have been developed and commercialised. Application of these methods is 
limited due to a lack of infrastructure and resources. Other challenges 
regarding integration and sustainability of technological and community-based 
mycotoxin reduction strategies include (i) food security, and (ii) the 
traditional use of mouldy maize.",

3TU.","BACKGROUND: Nutritional interventions to prevent stunting of infants and young 
children are most often applied in rural areas in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMIC). Few interventions are focused on urban slums. The literature 
needs a systematic assessment, as infants and children living in slums are at 
high risk of stunting. Urban slums are complex environments in terms of 
biological, social, and political variables and the outcomes of nutritional 
interventions need to be assessed in relation to these variables. For the 
purposes of this review, we followed the UN-Habitat 2004 definitions for 
low-income informal settlements or slums as lacking one or more indicators of 
basic services or infrastructure.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of nutritional interventions to reduce stunting 
in infants and children under five years old in urban slums from LMIC and the 
effect of nutritional interventions on other nutritional (wasting and 
underweight) and non-nutritional outcomes (socioeconomic, health and 
developmental) in addition to stunting.
SEARCH METHODS: The review used a sensitive search strategy of electronic 
databases, bibliographies of articles, conference proceedings, websites, grey 
literature, and contact with experts and authors published from 1990. We 
searched 32 databases, in English and non-English languages (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, 
Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, etc). We performed the initial literature search 
from November 2015 to January 2016, and conducted top up searches in March 2017 
and in August 2018.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Research designs included randomised (including 
cluster-randomised) trials, quasi-randomised trials, non-randomised controlled 
trials, controlled before-and-after studies, pre- and postintervention, 
interrupted time series (ITS), and historically controlled studies among infants 
and children from LMIC, from birth to 59 months, living in urban slums. The 
interventions included were nutrition-specific or maternal education. The 
primary outcomes were length or height expressed in cm or length-for-age 
(LFA)/height-for-age (HFA) z-scores, and birth weight in grams or 
presence/absence of low birth weight (LBW).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened and then retrieved titles and 
abstracts as full text if potentially eligible for inclusion. Working 
independently, one review author screened all titles and abstracts and extracted 
data on the selected population, intervention, comparison, and outcome 
parameters and two other authors assessed half each. We calculated mean 
selection difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We performed 
intervention-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, or 
narrative synthesis when meta-analyses were not possible. We used P less than 
0.05 to assess statistical significance and intervention outcomes were also 
considered for their biological/health importance. Where effect sizes were small 
and statistically insignificant, we concluded there was 'unclear effect'.
MAIN RESULTS: The systematic review included 15 studies, of which 14 were 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The interventions took place in recognised 
slums or poor urban or periurban areas. The study locations were mainly 
Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The participants included 9261 infants and children 
and 3664 pregnant women. There were no dietary intervention studies. All the 
studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. 
The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three 
studies), micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (eight 
studies), nutrition education for pregnant women (two studies), and nutrition 
systems strengthening targeting children (two studies) intervention. Six 
interventions were adapted to the urban context and seven targeted household, 
community, or 'service delivery' via systems strengthening. The primary review 
outcomes were available from seven studies for LFA/HFA, four for LBW, and nine 
for length.The studies had overall high risk of bias for 11 studies and only 
four RCTs had moderate risk of bias. Overall, the evidence was complex to 
report, with a wide range of outcome measures reported. Consequently, only eight 
study findings were reported in meta-analyses and seven in a narrative form. The 
certainty of evidence was very low to moderate overall. None of the studies 
reported differential impacts of interventions relevant to equity issues.Zinc 
supplementation of pregnant women on LBW or length (versus supplementation 
without zinc or placebo) (three RCTs)There was no evidence of an effect on LBW 
(MD -36.13 g, 95% CI -83.61 to 11.35), with moderate-certainty evidence, or no 
evidence of an effect or unclear effect on length with low- to 
moderate-certainty evidence.Micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in 
children (versus no intervention or placebo) (eight RCTs)There was no evidence 
of an effect or unclear effect of nutrient supplementation of children on HFA 
for studies in the meta-analysis with low-certainty evidence (MD -0.02, 95% CI 
-0.06 to 0.02), and inconclusive effect on length for studies reported in a 
narrative form with very low- to moderate-certainty evidence.Nutrition education 
for pregnant women (versus standard care or no intervention) (two RCTs)There was 
a positive impact on LBW of education interventions in pregnant women, with 
low-certainty evidence (MD 478.44g, 95% CI 423.55 to 533.32).Nutrition systems 
strengthening interventions targeting children (compared with no intervention, 
standard care) (one RCT and one controlled before-and-after study)There were 
inconclusive results on HFA, with very low- to low-certainty evidence, and a 
positive influence on length at 18 months, with low-certainty evidence.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All the nutritional interventions reviewed had the 
potential to decrease stunting, based on evidence from outside of slum contexts; 
however, there was no evidence of an effect of the interventions included in 
this review (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Challenges linked to 
urban slum programming (high mobility, lack of social services, and high loss of 
follow-up) should be taken into account when nutrition-specific interventions 
are proposed to address LBW and stunting in such environments. More evidence is 
needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions, combining 
nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes, as well as the effects 
of 'up-stream' practices and policies of governmental, non-governmental 
organisations, and the business sector on nutrition-related outcomes such as 
stunting.",

This study aimed to determine the relationship between stunting in children 6 to 36 months old and maternal employment status in Peru.

Methods
A secondary data analysis was conducted using information from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Peru. We used a representative sample of 4637 mother-child binomials to determine the association between stunting in children 6 to 36 months of age and the employment status of their mothers.

Results
The prevalence of stunting among children was 15.9% (95% CI: 13.916.7). The prevalence of working mothers was 63.7%. No association was found between maternal employment status and the presence of stunting in children [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.04; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.9 to 1.2; p = 0.627). However, on multivariate analysis we found that the prevalence of stunting was significantly higher among children of mothers performing unpaid work (12.4%) (PR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.21.6; p < 0.001) compared with those of paid working mothers.

Conclusion
No significant association was found between maternal employment status and the presence of stunting in children 6 to 36 months of age. However, children of mothers doing unpaid work are at higher risk of stunting. These findings support the implementation of educational programs and labour policies to reduce the prevalence of stunting among children.",

at reducing stunting and other inadequate growth measures in early childhood. 
The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relation between ASF 
consumption and stunting in children aged 6-60 mo in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). The secondary aim was to examine the relation between ASF 
consumption and other indicators of growth and development (length/height, 
weight, head circumference, and anemia). A search of the peer-reviewed and grey 
literature published from January 1980 to June 2017 was conducted. Databases 
searched included CINAHL, Embase, Global Index Medicus, PubMed, and Web of 
Science. There were 14,783 records and 116 full text articles dual screened; 21 
studies were included in the review and were dual evaluated for risk of bias 
(RoB). The relation between ASF and stunting (length- or height-for-age 
z-score←2) was examined in randomized-controlled trials [(RCTs), n = 3] and 
cross-sectional studies (n = 4) only; ASF reduced stunting in 1 RCT and was 
associated with reduced stunting in 1 cross-sectional study. We did not identify 
any longitudinal cohorts that examined this relation. The relation between ASF 
and secondary indicators length/height, weight, head circumference, and anemia 
were largely nonsignificant across study designs. The intervention/exposure, 
comparator, outcome measures, methods, and analyses were highly heterogeneous. 
Although we did not find a consistent relation between ASF consumption and our 
primary and secondary outcomes, this may have been a function of inconsistencies 
in study design. Foods in the whole diet, particularly combination dishes, are 
inherently difficult to assess. To quantitatively assess the relation between 
ASF and stunting and other indicators of growth and iron status in early 
childhood, future research should provide consistency in the definition and 
quantification of the exposure and outcomes allowing for interstudy quantitative 
comparisons.",

children under five. This study aims to examine the determinants of stunting in 
children aged 0-2 years in Indonesia using data derived from the 2013 Indonesia 
Basic Health Survey. Twenty potential predictors of stunting, categorized into 
household and housing characteristics; maternal and paternal characteristics; 
antenatal care services and child characteristics were analyzed. Multilevel 
analyses were performed to examine the role of cluster/district/provincial 
differences, as well as individual/household level characteristics and stunting 
status. Of 24,657 children analyzed, 33.7% (95%CI: 32.8%-34.7%) were stunted. 
The odds of stunting increased significantly among children living in households 
with three or more children under five-years-old (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.03-1.72), 
households with five to seven household members (aOR =1.11; 95%CI: 1.03-1.20), 
children whose mothers during pregnancy attended less than four antenatal care 
services (aOR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.08-1.39), boys (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.22-1.45),

optimal growth but challenging to measure comprehensively. This paper describes 
CF practices in 2,034 children aged 6-23 months and investigates their 
relationships with length-for-age z-score (LAZ) and stunting, using 
cross-sectional data collected from May to July 2014 in rural Northern Togo. The 
World Health Organization infant and young child feeding indicators were 
computed, along with ancillary indicators on feeding style and timing of 
introduction of complementary foods. The associations between those indicators 
and children's LAZ and stunting were assessed using linear and logistic 
regressions after stratification by age group and adjustment for children, 
maternal, and household characteristics. CF practices were suboptimal, and their 
associations with child's growth varied across indicators and age groups. In 
children aged 6-11 months, reaching the minimum dietary diversity and the 
minimum acceptable diet was associated with higher LAZ (p < .05). In 18- to 
23-month-old children, only the consumption of iron-rich food was associated 
with both LAZ (p = .02) and stunting (p = .05). The late introduction of family 
foods was associated with higher odds of being stunted and lower LAZ in children 
aged 12-17 months (p < .001). The untimely introduction of porridge was 
associated with higher odds of stunting in children aged 9-23 months (p < .05). 
Unexpectedly, helping the child to eat was negatively associated with linear 
growth in all age groups. These findings nurture the ongoing process of review 
of the World Health Organization infant and young child feeding indicators 
showing that, in their current version, they hardly capture the links between CF 
and child's growth at different ages.",

children; how this affects bone and muscle development is unclear. We 
investigated differences in bone and muscle mass and muscle function between 
children with HIV (CWH) and uninfected children.
SETTING: Cross-sectional study of CWH (6-16 years) receiving antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) for >6 months and similar aged children testing HIV-negative at 
primary health clinics in Zimbabwe.
METHODS: From Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) we calculated total-body 
less-head (TBLH) Bone Mineral Content (BMC) for lean mass adjusted-for-height 
(TBLH-BMCLBM) Z-scores, and lumbar spine (LS) Bone Mineral Apparent Density 
(BMAD) Z-scores.
RESULTS: The 97 CWH were older (mean age 12.7 vs. 10.0 years) and taller (mean 
height 142 cm vs. 134 cm) than 77 uninfected. However, stunting (height-for-age 
Z-score ≤ -2) was more prevalent in CWH (35% vs. 5%, p < 0.001). Among CWH, 15% 
had low LS-BMAD (Z-score ≤ -2) and 13% low TBLH-BMCLBM, vs. 1% and 3% 
respectively in those uninfected (both p ≤ 0.02). After age, sex, height and 
puberty adjustment, LS-BMAD was 0.33 SDs (95%CI -0.01, 0.67; p = 0.06) lower in 
CWH, with no differences by HIV status in TBLH-BMCLBM, lean mass (0.11 [-0.03, 
0.24], p = 0.11) or grip strength (0.05 [-0.16, 0.27], p = 0.62). However, age 
at ART initiation was correlated with both LS-BMAD Z-score (r = -0.33, 
p = 0.001) and TBLH-BMCLBM Z-score (r = -0.23, p = 0.027); for each year ART 
initiation was delayed a 0.13 SD reduction in LS-BMAD was seen.
CONCLUSION: Size-adjusted low bone density is common in CWH. Delay in initiating 
ART adversely affects bone density. Findings support immediate ART initiation at 
HIV diagnosis.",

environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), continues to plague young children in 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Diets in LMICs are primarily plant 
based, and thus have poor-quality protein and low levels of essential 
micronutrients. The aim of this study was to assess the association of the type 
and protein quality of food consumed with stunting, EED and acute malnutrition 
in children aged 6⁻36 months in Limera and Masenjere, two rural Southern 
Malawian communities. This is a secondary analysis of two randomized controlled 
trials that tested the effects of common bean and cowpea flour on stunting in 
children aged 6⁻36 months. We used data from two interactive 24-h dietary 
recalls conducted 12 weeks after enrolment into each trial. Food intakes were 
compared between the regions using Chi-square and Student's t-test. There were 
355 children that participated in the dietary recalls. The diets of children 
were of poor quality, but the children from Limera consumed more fish (54% vs. 
35%, p = 0.009) and more bioavailable protein (26.0 ± 10.3 g/day vs. 23.1 ± 8.1 
g/day, p = 0.018, respectively) than children in Masenjere. Food type and 
protein quality were not associated with any of the outcomes except an 
association between animal protein consumption and improvement in height-for-age 
z scores in children aged 12⁻36 months (p = 0.047). These findings support the 
notion that animal-source food (ASF) consumption in this vulnerable population 
promotes linear growth.",

understood, largely because of a lack of high-quality longitudinal data from 
children at risk of undernutrition.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the interrelationships between 
wasting and stunting in children aged <2 y.
METHODS: This study involved a retrospective cohort analysis, based on 
growth-monitoring records spanning 4 decades from clinics in rural Gambia. 
Anthropometric data collected at scheduled infant welfare clinics were converted 
to z scores, comprising 64,342 observations on 5160 subjects (median: 12 
observations per individual). Children were defined as ""wasted"" if they had a 
weight-for-length z score <-2 against the WHO reference and ""stunted"" if they 
had a length-for-age z score <-2.
RESULTS: Levels of wasting and stunting were high in this population, peaking at 
approximately (girls-boys) 12-18% at 10-12 months (wasted) and 37-39% at 24 mo 
of age (stunted). Infants born at the start of the annual wet season 
(July-October) showed early growth faltering in weight-for-length z score, 
putting them at increased risk of subsequent stunting. Using time-lagged 
observations, being wasted was predictive of stunting (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.7, 
3.9), even after accounting for current stunting. Boys were more likely to be 
wasted, stunted, and concurrently wasted and stunted than girls, as well as 
being more susceptible to seasonally driven growth deficits.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that stunting is in part a biological response 
to previous episodes of being wasted. This finding suggests that stunting may 
represent a deleterious form of adaptation to more overt undernutrition 
(wasting). This is important from a policy perspective as it suggests we are 
failing to recognize the importance of wasting simply because it tends to be 
more acute and treatable. These data suggest that stunted children are not just 
short children but are children who earlier were more seriously malnourished and 
who are survivors of a composite process.",

Indonesia is high (30.7%). Pesticides have been massively used in Indonesian 
agricultural areas.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if exposure to pesticides is associated with stunting 
among children in agricultural areas.
METHODS: This case-control study included 160 children (48 cases and 112 
controls) aged 8-12 years. Exposure to pesticides was measured based on the 
history of the exposure since perinatal period, infancy, and childhood of the 
participants. Stunting was determined as a height for age z-score (HAZ) < ‑2 SD. 
Other variables measured were levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hemoglobin, zinc, albumin, nutrient 
adequacy level (energy and protein), and history of infection, low-birth weight 
(LBW), and mother's height.
RESULTS: There were no significant difference between the cases and controls in 
terms of in the baseline characteristics, except for the median IGF-1 level; it 
was significantly (p<0.001) lower in the cases (66.73 ng/mL) than the controls 
(112.57 ng/mL). High level of pesticide exposure (p=0.029) and low IGF-1 levels 
(p<0.001) were significantly associated with stunting. After adjusting for 
confounding variables, these variables were found to be independent risk factors 
for stunting in children (aOR 3.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 13.26; and aOR 8.35, 95% CI 
3.65 to 19.14, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Pesticide exposure could be a risk factor for the occurrence of 
growth disorders in children living in agricultural areas. Necessary actions 
should be taken to protect children living in agricultural areas from exposure 
to pesticides.",

lower than minus two, is one of the key indicators for assessing well-being and 
health of a child; and can be used for monitoring child health inequalities. 
Thailand has been successful in improving health and providing financial 
protection for its population. A better understanding of the determinants of 
stunting will help fill both knowledge and policy gaps which promote children's 
health and well-being. This study assesses the factors contributing to stunting 
among Thai children aged less than five years.
METHODS: This study obtained data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 
Round 4 (MICS4), conducted in Thailand in 2012. Data analysis consisted of three 
steps. First, descriptive statistics provided an overview of data. Second, a 
Chi-square test determined the association between each covariate and stunting. 
Finally, multivariable logistic regression assessed the likelihood of stunting 
from all independent variables. Interaction effects between breastfeeding and 
household economy were added in the multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: In the analysis without interaction effects, while the perceived size 
of children at birth as 'small' were positively associated with stunting, 
children in the well-off households were less likely to experience stunting. The 
analysis of the interactions between 'duration of breastfeeding' and 
'household's economic level' found that the odds of stunting in children who 
were breastfed longer than 12 months in the poorest household quintile were 1.8 
fold (95% Confidence interval: 1.3-2.6) higher than the odds found in mothers 
from the same poorest quintiles, but without prolonged breastfeeding. However 
prolonged breastfeeding in most well-off households (those between the second 
quintile and the fifth wealth quintile) did not show a tendency towards 
stunting.
CONCLUSIONS: Childhood stunting was significantly associated with several 
factors. Prolonged breastfeeding beyond 12 months when interacting with poor 
economic status of a household potentiated stunting. Children living in the 
least well-off households were more prone to stunting than others. We recommend 
that the MICS survey questionnaire be amended to capture details on quantity, 
quality and practices of supplementary feeding. Multi-sectoral nutrition 
policies targeting poor households are required to address stunting challenges.",

stunting in the northern province of Rwanda by assessing anthropometric status, 
dietary intake, and overall complementary feeding practices.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with 138 children 5 to 30 mo of age. A 
structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic 
characteristics of each mother and child and breastfeeding and complementary 
feeding practices. Anthropometric status was assessed using height-for-age 
z-scores for children and body mass index for caregivers. Dietary intakes were 
estimated using a 24-h recall. Multiple linear and logistic regression models 
were performed to study the predictors of height-for-age z scores and stunting.
RESULTS: There was a 42% stunting prevalence. Prevalence of continued 
breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding were 92% and 50%, respectively. Most 
children (62%) fell into the low dietary diversity score group. The nutrient 
intake from complementary foods was below recommendations. The odds of stunting 
were higher in children >12 mo of age (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.08-1.29). Exclusive breastfeeding (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.48) 
and deworming tablet use in the previous 6 mo (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07-0.80) 
decreased significantly the odds of stunting in children. Also, the body mass 
index of the caretaker (β = 0.08 kg/m2; 95% CI, 0.00-0.17) and dietary zinc

been used since the 1990s for global monitoring of malnutrition. Recent 
developments prompted a re-examination of existing ranges and development of new 
ones for childhood overweight. The present paper reports from the WHO-UNICEF 
Technical Expert Advisory Group on Nutrition Monitoring.
DESIGN: Thresholds were developed in relation to sd of the normative WHO Child 
Growth Standards. The international definition of 'normal' (2 sd below/above the 
WHO standards median) defines the first threshold, which includes 2·3 % of the 
area under the normalized distribution. Multipliers of this 'very low' level 
(rounded to 2·5 %) set the basis to establish subsequent thresholds. Country 
groupings using the thresholds were produced using the most recent set of 
national surveys.
SETTING: One hundred and thirty-four countries.
SUBJECTS: Children under 5 years.
RESULTS: For wasting and overweight, thresholds are: 'very low' (≈6 times 2·5 
%). For stunting, thresholds are: 'very low' (≈12 times 2·5 %).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed thresholds minimize changes and keep coherence across 
anthropometric indicators. They can be used for descriptive purposes to map 
countries according to severity levels; by donors and global actors to identify 
priority countries for action; and by governments to trigger action and target 
programmes aimed at achieving 'low' or 'very low' levels. Harmonized terminology 
will help avoid confusion and promote appropriate interventions.",

stunted. Global-level modeling has consistently found climate change impacts on 
food production are likely to impair progress on reducing undernutrition.
OBJECTIVES: We adopt a new perspective, assessing how climate change may affect 
child stunting via its impacts on two interacting socioeconomic drivers: incomes 
of the poorest 20% of populations (due to climate impacts on crop production, 
health, labor productivity, and disasters) and food prices.
METHODS: We developed a statistical model to project moderate and severe 
stunting in children aged [Formula: see text] at the national level in 2030 
under low and high climate change scenarios combined with poverty and prosperity 
scenarios in 44 countries.
RESULTS: We estimated that in the absence of climate change, 110 million 
children aged [Formula: see text] would be stunted in 2030 under the poverty 
scenario in comparison with 83 million under the prosperity scenario. Estimates 
of climate change-attributable stunting ranged from 570,000 under the 
prosperity/low climate change scenario to [Formula: see text] under the 
poverty/high climate change scenario. The projected impact of climate change on 
stunting was greater in rural vs. urban areas under both socioeconomic 
scenarios. In countries with lower incomes and relatively high food prices, we 
projected that rising prices would tend to increase stunting, whereas in 
countries with higher incomes and relatively low food prices, rising prices 
would tend to decrease stunting. These findings suggest that food prices that 
provide decent incomes to farmers alongside high employment with living wages 
will reduce undernutrition and vulnerability to climate change.
CONCLUSIONS: Shifting the focus from food production to interactions between 
incomes and food price provides new insights. Futures that protect health should 
consider not just availability, accessibility, and quality of food, but also the 
incomes generated by those producing the food. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2916.",

patterns amongst women of reproductive age and children aged 6-59 months from 
urban poor settlements of Lusaka and their implications for nutritional status. 
Particular emphasis was placed on the role of fish in their diets and 
nutritional status.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was applied, in which 714 mother-child 
dyads, with children aged 6-59 months were enrolled. A three-stage randomized 
cluster sampling approach was applied.
RESULTS: The mean dietary diversity score among children aged 6-23 and 24-59 
months was 2.98 (±1.27) and 3.478 (±1.07), respectively. In children aged 6-23 
months, there was a significant difference in their nutritional status, based on 
fish consumption (χ2 = 10.979, df = 2, p = 0.004). Children from poorer 
households consumed mostly small fish (Kapenta). The quantity of fish consumed 
by children was significantly associated with stunting in both age groups, odds 
ratio = 0.947 (95% CI: 0.896, 1.000) for children aged 6-23 months and odds 
ratio = 1.038 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.072) for children aged 24-59 months old. Other 
significant risk factors for stunting in children aged 6-23 months were the 
child's age, mother's body mass index, access to treated water and child 
morbidity. Child's age, mother's educational level and wealth status were 
determinants of dietary diversity in children aged 6-59 months as shown by the 
Poisson regression.
CONCLUSION: Nutritional status of children aged 6-23 months is associated with 
fish consumption, with children consuming fish less likely to be stunted. Small 
fish (Kapenta) is an animal-source food that is particularly important in the 
diet of children in urban poor households in Zambia and contributes to better 
nutritional outcomes. As all small fish stem from capture fisheries, sustainable 
one health environmental integration, monitoring and management strategies are 
desirable.",

status and growth, yet evidence on this relationship is conflicting. The aim of 
this study was to assess the association between dental caries in both the 
primary and permanent dentition and nutritional status (including underweight, 
normal weight, overweight and stunting) in children from Cambodia, Indonesia and 
Lao PDR over a period of 2 years. A second objective was to assess whether 
nutritional status affects the eruption of permanent teeth.
METHODS: Data were used from the Fit for School - Health Outcome Study: a cohort 
study with a follow-up period of 2 years, consisting of children from 82 
elementary schools in Cambodia, Indonesia and Lao PDR. From each school, a 
random sample of six to seven-year-old children was selected. Dental caries and 
odontogenic infections were assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria and the pufa-index. Weight and height measurements were converted to 
BMI-for-age and height-for-age z-scores and categorized into weight status and 
stunting following WHO standardised procedures. Cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations were analysed using the Kruskal Wallis test, Mann Whitney U-test 
and multivariate logistic and linear regression.
RESULTS: Data of 1499 children (mean age at baseline = 6.7 years) were analyzed. 
Levels of dental caries and odontogenic infections in the primary dentition were 
significantly highest in underweight children, as well as in stunted children, 
and lowest in overweight children. Dental caries in six to seven-year old 
children was also significantly associated with increased odds of being 
underweight and stunted 2 years later. These associations were not consistently 
found for dental caries and odontogenic infections in the permanent dentition. 
Underweight and stunting was significantly associated with a lower number of 
erupted permanent teeth in children at the age of six to seven-years-old and 2 
years later.
CONCLUSIONS: Underweight and stunted growth are associated with untreated dental 
caries and a delayed eruption of permanent teeth in children from Cambodia, 
Indonesia and Lao PDR. Findings suggest that oral health may play an important 
role in children's growth and general development.

households. However, the quality of mother's diets is often neglected, which may 
affect both mother's and child's nutrition. Because no single food contains all 
necessary nutrients, diversity in dietary sources is needed to ensure a quality 
diet. We aimed to study the association between mother's dietary diversity and 
stunting in children <2 years attending Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b, a diarrhoeal 
disease hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A case-control study (n = 296) was 
conducted from November 2016 to February 2017. Data were collected from mothers 
of stunted children <2 years (length-for-age z score [LAZ] < -2) as ""cases"" and 
nonstunted (LAZ ≥ -1) children <2 years as ""controls."" Mothers were asked to 
recall consumption of 10 defined food groups 24 hr prior to the interview as per 
Guidelines for Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women. Among the mothers of cases, 
58% consumed <5 food groups during the last 24 hr, compared with 45% in control 
mothers (P = 0.03). Children whose mothers consumed <5 food groups were 1.7 
times more likely to be stunted than children whose mothers consumed ≥5 food 
groups (P = 0.04). Intake of food groups such as pulses, dairy, eggs, and 
vitamin A rich fruit was higher in control mothers. Proportion of mother's 
illiteracy, short stature, monthly family income <BDT 11,480, absence of bank 
account, and poor sanitation was also found to be higher in stunted group. 
Further study particularly intervention or longitudinal study to see the 
causality of mother's dietary diversity with child stunting is recommended.",

on dietary diversity. The Sustainable Undernutrition Reduction in Ethiopia 
(SURE) programme is a government-led multisectoral intervention that aims to 
integrate the work of the health and agriculture sectors to deliver a complex 
multicomponent intervention to improve child feeding and reduce stunting. The 
Federal Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Natural Resources implement the 
intervention. The evaluation aims to assess a range of processes, outcomes and 
impacts.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The SURE evaluation study is a theory-based, mixed methods 
study comprising impact and process evaluations. We hypothesise that the package 
of SURE interventions, including integrated health and agriculture behaviour 
change communication for nutrition, systems strengthening and multisectoral 
coordination, will result in detectable differences in minimum acceptable diet 
in children 6-23 months and stunting in children 24-47 months between 
intervention and comparison groups. Repeated cross-sectional household surveys 
will be conducted at baseline and endline to assess impact. The process will be 
assessed using observations, key informant interviews and focus group 
discussions to investigate the fidelity and dose of programme implementation, 
behavioural pathways of impact and contextual factors interacting with the 
intervention. Pathways of impact will also be explored through statistical 
analyses.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethics approval from the 
scientific and ethical review committees at the Ethiopian Public Health 
Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The findings 
will be disseminated collaboratively with stakeholders at specified time points 
and through peer-reviewed publications and presentations.",

stunting in children in many Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). We 
assessed the availability, affordability, and nutrient adequacy of imported and 
locally produced processed cereal-based blends (PCBBs), marketed as 
complementary food for young children in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and 
Senegal. In total, 19 local producers and 275 points of sale in the four 
countries were surveyed to evaluate the quantities and accessibility of PCBBs. 
In addition, 32 PCBBs were analysed for their nutritional composition and 
packaging information. The results showed that only 7 out of 32 PCBBs could be 
classified as nutritionally satisfactory. Access to the products was 
insufficient in all surveyed settings. At the points of sale, the PCBB market 
was dominated by imported products, even though two out of four imported PCBBs 
were not nutritionally satisfactory. Imported PCBBs were two to three times more 
expensive than locally produced PCBBs. Labelling of the PCBBs was inadequate in 
many aspects. Technical support should be offered to local PCBB producers to 
ensure the adequate formulation and supply of an appropriate vitamin and mineral 
premix. The development of national specific regulations on PCBB composition and 
labelling is strongly recommended in these countries.",

underweight and stunting in children still persist as public health issues 
especially in Africa and Asia. Adequate nutrition is one of the key factors for 
healthy growth and development of children. In this study, the associations 
between dairy consumption and nutritional status in the South East Asian 
Nutrition Survey (SEANUTS) were investigated. National representative data of 
12,376 children in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam aged between 1 and 
12 years were pooled, representing nearly 88 million children in this age 
category. It was found that the prevalence of stunting and underweight was lower 
in children who consumed dairy on a daily basis (10.0% and 12.0%, respectively) 
compared to children who did not use dairy (21.4% and 18.0%, respectively) (p < 
0.05). The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency was 
lower in the group of dairy users (3.9% and 39.4%, respectively) compared to 
non-dairy consumers (7.5% and 53.8%, respectively) (p < 0.05). This study 
suggests that dairy as part of a daily diet plays an important role in growth 
and supports a healthy vitamin A and vitamin D status.",

whom live in rural areas. Bananas (Musa spp.) are the staple food of Uganda with 
the East African Highland banana, a cooking banana, the primary starch source. 
Unfortunately, these bananas are low in pro-vitamin A (PVA) and iron and, as a 
result, banana-based diets are low in these micronutrients which results in very 
high levels of inadequate nutrition. This inadequate nutrition manifests as high 
levels of vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and stunting in 
children. A project known as Banana21 commenced in 2005 to alleviate 
micronutrient deficiencies in Uganda and surrounding countries through the 
generation of farmer- and consumer-acceptable edible bananas with significantly 
increased fruit levels of PVA and iron. A genetic modification approach was 
adopted since bananas are recalcitrant to conventional breeding. In this review, 
we focus on the PVA-biofortification component of the Banana21 project and 
describe the proof-of-concept studies conducted in Australia, the transfer of 
the technology to our Ugandan collaborators, and the successful implementation 
of the strategy into the field in Uganda. The many challenges encountered and

interventions and nutritional status of children in Ethiopia between 2000 and 
2011. Using the Lives Saved Tool, the impact of changes in coverage of child 
survival interventions on under-5 lives saved was estimated.
METHODS: Estimates of child mortality were generated using three Ethiopia 
Demographic and Health Surveys undertaken between 2000 and 2011. Coverage 
indicators for high impact child health interventions were calculated and the 
Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was used to estimate child lives saved in 2011.
RESULTS: The mortality rate in children younger than 5 years decreased rapidly 
from 218 child deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval 183 to 252) 
in the period 1987-1991 to 88 child deaths per 1000 live births in the period 
2007-2011 (78 to 98). The prevalence of moderate or severe stunting in children 
aged 6-35 months also declined significantly. Improvements in the coverage of 
interventions relevant to child survival in rural areas of Ethiopia between 2000 
and 2011 were found for tetanus toxoid, DPT3 and measles vaccination, oral 
rehydration solution (ORS) and care-seeking for suspected pneumonia. The LiST 
analysis estimates that there were 60 700 child deaths averted in 2011, 
primarily attributable to decreases in wasting rates (18%), stunting rates (13%) 
and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions (13%).
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the nutritional status of children and increases in 
coverage of high impact interventions most notably WASH and ORS have contributed 
to the decline in under-5 mortality in Ethiopia. These proximal determinants 
however do not fully explain the mortality reduction which is plausibly also due 
to the synergistic effect of major child health and nutrition policies and 
delivery strategies.",

ambient air pollution. Maternal exposure to fine particulate matter has been 
associated with low birth weight at much lower levels of exposure, leading us to 
suspect the potentially large effects of air pollution on stunting in children 
in Bangladesh. We estimate the relationship between exposure to air pollution in

nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted 
between 2004 and 2014, and calculating children's exposure to ambient fine 
particulate matter in utero using high resolution satellite data. We find 
significant increases in the relative risk of child stunting, wasting, and 
underweight with higher levels of in utero exposure to air pollution, after 
controlling for other factors that have been found to contribute to child 
anthropometric failure. We estimate the relative risk of stunting in the second, 
third, and fourth quartiles of exposure as 1.074 (95% confidence interval: 
1.014-1.138), 1.150 (95% confidence interval: 1.069-1.237, and 1.132 (95%

countries. It is one of the most important risk factors for morbidity and 
mortality during childhood. In Palestine, it is another health problem, which 
adds to the catastrophic issues in the region. This study aimed to determine the 
prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among preschool children in 
the Gaza Strip.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted in the Gaza Strip. A total 
of 357 children aged 2-5 years and their mothers aged 18-50 years were 
recruited. A multistage cluster sampling was used in the selection of the study 
participants from three geographical areas in the Gaza Strip: Jabalia refugee 
camp, El Remal urban area, and Al Qarara rural area. A structured questionnaire 
was used for face- to -face interviews with the respective child's mother to 
collect sociodemographic information and feeding practice. Anthropometric 
measurements for children were taken to classify height-for-age (HAZ), while 
maternal height was measured as well. Descriptive and binary logistic regression 
analyses were applied to determine the prevalence and associated factors 
with stunting.
RESULTS: The total prevalence of stunting in this study was 19.6%, with the 
highest prevalence being (22.6%) in Jabalia refugee camp. It turns out that 
shorter mothers had increased the odds of stunting in preschool children in the 
Gaza Strip. Children born to mothers whose height was 1.55-1.60 m or <1.55 m 
were more likely to be stunted (p = 0. 008), or (p < 0.001), respectively, than 
children born to mothers whose height was >1.60 m. Moreover, parental 
consanguinity increased the risk of stunted children (p = 0. 015).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the prevalence of stunting was of alarming 
magnitude in the Gaza Strip. Our results also demonstrated that parental 
consanguinity and short maternal stature were associated with stunting. 
Culturally appropriate interventions and appropriate strategies should be 
implemented to discourage these types of marriages. Policy makers must also 
raise awareness of the importance of the prevention and control of nutritional 
problems to combat stunting among children in the Gaza Strip.",

in the Andes and its association with undernutrition. We evaluated the vitamin D 
status of children residing in a low socio-economic status (SES) setting in the 
Ecuadorian Andes and assessed the association between vitamin D status, stunting 
and underweight. We hypothesized that children who were underweight would have 
lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and lower 25(OH)D levels would 
be associated with a higher risk of stunting.
DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional secondary analysis of a randomized 
controlled trial, the Vitamin A, Zinc and Pneumonia study. Children had serum 
25(OH)D concentrations measured. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to 
determine a vitamin D cut-off specific for our endpoints. Associations between 
serum 25(OH)D and underweight (defined as weight-for-age Z-score≤-1) and 
stunting (defined as height-for-age Z-score≤-2) were assessed using multivariate 
logistic regression.
SETTING: Children residing in five low-SES peri-urban neighbourhoods near Quito, 
Ecuador.
SUBJECTS: Children (n 516) aged 6-36 months.
RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 58·0 (sd 17·7) nmol/l. Sensitivity 
analysis revealed an undernutrition-specific 25(OH)D cut-off of <42·5 nmol/l; 
18·6 % of children had serum 25(OH)D<42·5 nmol/l. Children who were underweight 
were more likely to have serum 25(OH)D<42·5 nmol/l (adjusted OR (aOR)=2·0; 95 %

replicate within its host, leading to long-lasting and potentially fatal 
infections. It is ubiquitous and highly prevalent in Cambodia. The extent of 
morbidity associated with S. stercoralis infection is difficult to assess due to 
the broad spectrum of symptoms and, thus, remains uncertain.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clinical signs were compared among S. 
stercoralis infected vs. non-infected participants in a cross-sectional survey 
conducted in 2012 in eight villages of Northern Cambodia, and before and after 
treatment with a single oral dose of ivermectin (200μg/kg BW) among participants 
harboring S. stercoralis. Growth retardation among schoolchildren and 
adolescents was assessed using height-for-age and thinness using body mass 
index-for-age. S. stercoralis prevalence was 31.1% among 2,744 participants. 
Urticaria (55% vs. 47%, OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6) and itching (52% vs. 48%, OR: 
1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.4) were more frequently reported by infected participants. 
Gastrointestinal, dermatological, and respiratory symptoms were less prevalent 
in 103 mono-infected participants after treatment. Urticaria (66% vs. 11%, OR: 
0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.1) and abdominal pain (81 vs. 27%, OR: 0.07, 95% CI: 
0.02-0.2) mostly resolved by treatment. S. stercoralis infection was associated 
with stunting, with 2.5-fold higher odds in case of heavy infection.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The morbidity associated with S. stercoralis confirmed 
the importance of gastrointestinal and dermatological symptoms unrelated to 
parasite load, and long-term chronic effects when associated with malnutrition. 
The combination of high prevalence and morbidity calls for the integration of S. 
stercoralis into ongoing STH control measures in Cambodia.",

years old, despite a global mobilization against chronic malnutrition. In 
Madagascar, the most recent data show that the prevalence of stunting in 
children under five years old is still around 47.4%. This study aimed to 
identify the determinants of stunting in children in rural areas of Moramanga 
and Morondava districts to target the main areas for intervention.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in children aged from 6 to 59.9 
months, in 2014-2015. We measured the height and weight of mothers and children 
and collected data on child, mother and household characteristics. One stool 
specimen was collected from each child for intestinal parasite identification. 
We used a multivariate logistic regression model to identify the determinants of 
stunting using backwards stepwise methods.
RESULTS: We included 894 and 932 children in Moramanga and in Morondava 
respectively. Stunting was highly prevalent in both areas, being 52.8% and 40.0% 
for Moramanga and Morondava, respectively. Stunting was most associated with a 
specific age period (12mo to 35mo) in the two study sites. Infection with 
Trichuris trichiura (aOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.3) and those belonging to poorer 
households (aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.6-3.4) were the major risk factors in Moramanga. 
In Morondava, children whose mother had activities outside the household (aOR: 
1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.5) and those perceived to be small at birth (aOR: 1.6, 95% 
CI: 1.1-2.1) were more likely to be stunted, whereas adequate birth spacing 
(≥24months) appeared protective (aOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7).
CONCLUSION: Interventions that could improve children's growth in these two 
areas include poverty reduction, women's empowerment, public health programmes 
focusing on WASH and increasing acceptability, and increased coverage and 
quality of child/maternal health services.",

University, Kampala, Uganda.","BACKGROUND: Stunting affects close to 2.4 million children in Uganda, and it is 
among the major contributors to the annual loss in productivity of the 
equivalent of US$899 million.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify the key underlying causes of the 
persistently high stunting rates in a region of Uganda known to have low poverty 
rates and a high agricultural output.
METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in Buhweju district, 
southwest Uganda to compare prior exposures between stunted children (cases) and 
nonstunted children (controls).
RESULTS: The sample comprised 56 cases and 112 controls, totaling 168 children 
aged 6 to 59 months. There were almost equal numbers of boys and girls in the 
sample. Boys were significantly more likely to be stunted compared to girls 
(odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-4.2; P < .05). Stunted 
children were significantly less likely to be introduced to complementary foods 
at an appropriate age and their primary caregivers lacked knowledge about 
stunting. The odds of stunting were 2.4 times greater for children in 
food-insecure households compared to those in food-secure households (OR: 2.4, 
95% CI: 1.1-5.0; P < .05) and 4.5 times greater among children who resided in 
poor quality houses (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-13.0; P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Low access to appropriate complementary diets, sex of child, food 
insecurity, poor socioeconomic status, and low knowledge about stunting were the 
main predictors of childhood stunting in the study population.",

underfive, establishing it as a strong predictor of mortality in these children. 
Few studies have documented the prevalence or determinants of stunting among 
school children in southwestern Nigeria. The aim of the study was to determine 
the prevalence and predictors of stunting among selected primary school children 
in rural and urban communities of Obafemi Owode Local Government Area, Ogun 
State.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study of rural and urban primary school children was 
conducted. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect 
information on respondents' and parents' socio-demographic characteristics. 
Stunting was defined as height-for-age less than two standard deviations from 
the median height-for-age of the standard World Health Organization reference 
population. Using EPI-INFO version 6.03, children were classified as stunted if 
z-scores of height-for-age were less than 2 standard deviations below the 
National Centre for Health statistics (NCHS)/WHO median. Height and weight were 
taken using a stadiometer and weighing scale respectively. Data were analyzed 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 16.0 while 
predictors were determined using logistic regression at 95% level of 
significance.
RESULTS: A total of 1,160 primary school children were studied with 52.2% from 
rural schools. Males constituted 57.1% and 51.8% in the rural and urban school 
respectively. Prevalence of stunting among rural school children was 46.2%, and 
was significantly higher (p≤0.001) than among urban children at 33.8%. Younger 
children <10 years (OR: 0.088; 95CI: 0.052 - 0.150) and children between 11-12 
years (OR: 0.534; 95CI: 0.322 - 0.886) were at a significantly lower risk of 
stunting both in rural schools compared to children >13 years.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of stunting was high especially among pupils from 
schools in the rural communities. This underscores the need for urgent feasible 
and effective nutrition programs for primary school children especially those in 
rural schools within the study area.",

global targets for reductions in stunting and wasting by 2025. Improving 
complementary diets of children aged 6-23 mo is a recommended approach for 
reducing stunting in children <5 y old. Less is known about the potential of 
these interventions to prevent wasting.Objective: The aim of this article was to 
review and synthesize the current literature for the impact of complementary 
feeding interventions on linear [length-for-age z score (LAZ)] and ponderal 
[weight-for-length z score (WLZ)] growth of children aged 6-23 mo, with the 
specific goal of updating intervention-outcome linkages in the Lives Saved Tool 
(LiST).Methods: We started our review with studies included in the previous LiST 
review and searched for articles published since January 2012. We identified 
longitudinal trials that compared children aged 6-23 mo who received 1 of 2 
types of complementary feeding interventions (nutrition education or counseling 
alone or complementary food supplementation with or without nutrition education 
or counseling) with a no-intervention control. We assessed study quality and 
generated pooled estimates of LAZ and WLZ change, as well as length and weight 
gain, for each category of intervention.Results: Interventions that provided 
nutrition education or counseling had a small but significant impact on linear 
growth in food-secure populations [LAZ standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.11; 
95% CI: 0.01, 0.22] but not on ponderal growth. Complementary food 
supplementation interventions with or without nutrition education also had a 
small, significant effect in food-insecure settings on both LAZ (SMD: 0.08; 95% 
CI: 0.04, 0.13) and WLZ (SMD: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.08).Conclusions: Nutrition 
education and complementary feeding interventions both had a small but 
significant impact on linear growth, and complementary feeding interventions 
also had an impact on ponderal growth of children aged 6-23 mo in low- and 
middle-income countries. The updated LiST model will support nutrition program 
planning and evaluation efforts by allowing users to model changes in

slum areas of Bhubaneswar, India.","Panigrahi A(1), Das SC(1), Sahoo P(1).","Author information:
(1)Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India.","AIM: Adaptive functioning develops throughout early childhood, and its 
limitation is a reflection that the child has developmental or emotional 
problems or even mental retardation. Little is known about the adaptive 
functioning or developmental status of slum children. The present 
cross-sectional study was undertaken during the year 2014 to assess the status 
of adaptive functioning among girl children aged between 3 and 9 years residing 
in slum areas of Bhubaneswar and to explore the factors associated with poor 
adaptive functioning.
METHODS: Stratified multi-stage cluster random sampling technique was used to 
select the study population; 256 mother-child pairs from 256 households in 
selected slum areas were studied. Demographic information was collected, and 
adaptive functioning was assessed using the modified Vineland Social Maturity 
Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses was carried out using Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.
RESULTS: One-fifth (54, 21%) of the girls sampled had poor adaptive functioning, 
and 44 (17%) had poor cognitive functioning. Multivariate analysis revealed that 
the age of the child, parents' education, presence of stunting in children and 
attending school/early childhood centre were strong predictors of adaptive 
functioning in slum children.
CONCLUSION: One-fifth of girls from slums are developmentally vulnerable; 
parental education, stunting and early childhood education or exposure to 
schooling are modifiable factors influencing children's adaptive functioning. 
Health, education and welfare sectors need to be aware of this so that a 
multi-pronged approach can be planned to properly address this issue in one of 
the most disadvantaged sections of the society.",

and risk of childhood stunting and to determine whether this association is 
modified by maternal-child overweight/obesity.
DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Data come from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 
(ENSANUT 2012 by its initials in Spanish), representative of rural and urban 
areas.
PARTICIPANTS: Our study sample included 5087 mother-preschool child pairs and 
7181 mother-schoolchild pairs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in the prevalence (95% CI) of each HFI 
category by socioeconomic characteristics and maternal-child nutritional status 
were estimated. A logistic regression model was conducted for stunting and 
overweight among preschool children and for stunting and overweight/obesity 
among schoolchildren, adjusting for pertinent covariates. HFI was measured 
according to the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA by its 
initials in Spanish). Weight and recumbent lenght or height measures were 
obtained from children. Overweight and obesity in women were determined 
according to the WHO Growth Reference Charts. The following covariates were 
included: sex of the child. urbanicity (urban/rural), region of residence and 
maternal education. Benefiting from food assistance programmes and socioeconomic 
status index were also included. Results were expressed as adjusted ORs.
RESULTS: Stunting proved more prevalent in preschool children with moderate or 
severe HFI (16.2% and 16.8%, respectively) (p=0.036 and p=0.007, respectively) 
than in their counterparts with mild or no HFI (13.2% and 10.7%, respectively). 
Furthermore, the interaction between HFI and maternal obesity had a significant 
impact on stunting in preschool children (p<0.05). Severe HFI increased risk of 
stunting in children with non-obese mothers but not in those with obese mothers.
CONCLUSION: We have discovered a new relationship between HFI and maternal 
obesity on the one hand and risk of childhood stunting on the other hand. This 
may reflect a shared mechanism involving dual forms of malnutrition.",

particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Children at high risk of 
malnutrition should be prioritized to receive necessary interventions to 
minimize such risk. Several risk factors have been proposed; however, until now, 
there has been no appropriate evaluation method to identify these children. In 
sub-Saharan Africa, children commonly receive regular check-ups from community 
health workers. A simple and easy nutrition assessment method is therefore 
needed for use by semi-professional health workers.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop and test a practical screening 
tool for community use in predicting growth stunting in children under two years 
in rural Zambia.
METHODS: Field research was conducted from July to August 2014 in Southern 
Province, Zambia. Two hundred and sixty-four mother-child pairs participated in 
the study. Anthropometric measurements were performed on all children and 
mothers, and all mothers were interviewed. Risk factors for the screening test 
were estimated by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
analysis. After re-evaluating all participants using the new screening tool, a 
receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to set the cut-off value. 
Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated.
RESULTS: The screening tool included age, weight-for-age Z-score status, birth 
weight, feeding status, history of sibling death, multiple birth, and maternal 
education level. The total score ranged from 0 to 22, and the cut-off value was 
eight. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.963 and 0.697 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A screening tool was developed to predict children at high risk of 
malnutrition living in Zambia. Further longitudinal studies are needed to 
confirm the test's validity in detecting future stunting and to investigate the 
effectiveness of malnutrition treatment.",

routine pre and post-intervention cross-sectional nutrition survey data 
collected between 2008-2011 in five refugee camps in Kenya and Djibouti. Changes 
in total anaemia (Haemoglobin<110g/L), anaemia categories (mild, moderate and 
severe), and stunting (height-for-age z-score <-2) were explored using available 
data on the Nutributter® programme and contextual factors. A significant 
reduction in the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6-23 months and 6-59 
months was seen in four of five, and in all five camps, respectively (p<0.05). 
Reductions ranged from 12.4 to 23.0, and 18.3 to 29.3 percentage points in each 
age group. Improvements were largely due to reductions in moderate and severe 
anaemia and occurred where the prevalence of acute malnutrition was stable or 
increasing. No change in stunting was observed in four of five camps. The 
replicability of findings across five sites strongly suggests that Nutributter® 
distribution was associated with a reduction in anaemia, but not stunting, among 
refugee children in the Horn of Africa. Benefits were not restricted to the 6-23

middle income countries. In Pakistan, widespread food insecurity and 
malnutrition are the main contributors to poor health, low survival rates and 
the loss of human capital development. The nutritional status trends among 
children exhibit a continuous deteriorating with rates of malnutrition exceeding 
the WHO critical threshold. With the high prevalence of maternal and child 
malnutrition, it is important to identify effective preventative approaches, 
especially for reducing stunting in children under-five years of age. The 
primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of food-based 
interventions to prevent stunting in children under-five years.
METHODS: A mixed methods study design will be conducted to evaluate the 
effectiveness of food-based interventions to prevent stunting among children 
under-five years in districts Thatta and Sujawal, Sindh Province, Pakistan. The 
study will include cross sectional surveys, a community-based cluster randomized 
controlled trial and a process evaluation. The study participants will be 
pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under-five years. The 
cross-sectional surveys will be conducted with 7360 study participants at 
baseline and endline. For the randomized control trial, 5000 participants will 
be recruited and followed monthly for compliance of food-based supplements, 
dietary diversity, pregnancy outcomes, and maternal and child morbidity and 
mortality. Anthropometric measurements and hemoglobin levels will be measured at 
baseline, quarterly and at endline. The interventions will consist of locally 
produced lipid-based nutrient supplement (Wawamum) for children 6-23 months, 
micronutrient powders for children 24-59 months, and wheat soya blends for 
pregnant and lactating mothers. Government lady health workers will deliver 
interventions to participants. The effectiveness of the project will be measured 
in terms of the impact of the proposed interventions on stunting, nutritional 
status, micronutrient deficiencies, and other key indicators of the 
participants. The process evaluation will assess the acceptability, feasibility 
and potential barriers of project implementation through focus group 
discussions, key informant interviews and household surveys. Data analysis will 
be conducted using STATA version 12.
DISCUSSION: There is considerable evidence on the effectiveness of food-based 
interventions in managing stunting in developing countries. However, these 
studies do not account for the local environmental factors and widespread 
nutrient deficiencies in Pakistan. These studies are often conducted in 
controlled environments, where the results cannot be generalized to programs 
operating under field conditions. The findings of this study will provide 
sufficient evidence to develop policies and programs aimed to prevent stunting 
in children 6-59 months and to improve maternal and child health and growth 
outcomes in poor resource settings.

high in under 5 years old children. This study investigated the determinants of 
child stunting based on the UNICEF framework on the causes of malnutrition. A 
cutoff at 24 months was used to separate the child population into two groups. 
By using the latest Demographic and Health Survey (2009), logistic regressions 
were performed to determine the variables associated with stunting. In 2009, 
40.1% of the 1,863 children aged 0-23 months and 53.9% of the 2,911 children 
aged 24-59 months were stunted contributing to the 48.5% overall stunting 
prevalence in the sample. Girls were less likely to be stunted (adjusted odds 
ratio with confidence interval [AOR] = 0.69 [0.55-0.88] and 0.84 [0.72-0.97], 
p < 0.01) than boys; the risk of stunting increased with age. Regarding 
underlying predictors, increased maternal height was associated with lower odds 
of stunting in both age groups (AOR = 0.75 [0.68-0.83] and 0.69 [0.61-0.77], 
p < 0.001). Children living in households using iodized salt (>15 ppm) had lower 
risk of stunting in the younger group (AOR = 0.76 [0.61-0.94], p < 0.05). 
Children living in urban areas were less likely to be stunted in both age groups 
(AOR = 0.67 [0.51-0.88] and 0.73 [0.59-0.90] respectively, p < 0.01]. Region of 
residence was also a significant basic factor for stunting. This study 
contributes to the understanding of the determinants of child stunting in 
Madagascar. The results confirmed the need for specific interventions for each 
of the two age groups.",

on their survival and development. A contaminated environment is likely to 
contribute to stunting: frequent faecal-oral transmission possibly causes 
environmental enteropathy, a chronic inflammatory disorder that may contribute 
to faltering growth in children. This study's objective was to assess the effect 
of contaminated environment on stunting in Burkina Faso, where stunting 
prevalence is persistently high.
METHODS: Panel study of children aged 1-5 years in Kaya. Household socioeconomic 
characteristics, food needs and sanitary conditions were measured once, and 
child growth every year (2011-2014). Using multiple correspondence analysis and 
12 questions and observations on water, sanitation, hygiene behaviours, yard 
cleanliness and animal proximity, we constructed a 'contaminated environment' 
index as a proxy of faecal-oral transmission exposure. Analysis was performed 
using a generalised structural equation model (SEM), adjusting for repeat 
observations and hierarchical data.
RESULTS: Stunting (<2 SD height-for-age) prevalence was 29% among 3121 children 
(median (IQR) age 36 (25-48) months). Environment contamination was widespread, 
particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, and was associated with stunting 
(prevalence ratio 1.30; p=0.008), controlling for sex, age, survey year, 
setting, mother's education, father's occupation, household food security and 
wealth. This association was significant for children of all ages (1-5 years) 
and settings. Lower contamination and higher food security had effects of 
comparable magnitude.
CONCLUSIONS: Environment contamination can be at least as influential as 
nutritional components in the pathway to stunting. There is a rationale for 
including interventions to reduce environment contamination in stunting 
prevention programmes.",

nutrition, little attention is paid to nutrition capacity development. Although 
infant feeding counselling by health workers increases caregivers' knowledge, 
and improves breastfeeding, complementary feeding, and children's linear growth, 
most of the counselling in sub-Saharan Africa is primarily conducted by nurses 
or volunteers, and little is done to develop capacity for nutrition at the 
professional, organizational, or systemic levels. The Cameroon Baptist 
Convention Health Services Nutrition Improvement Program (NIP) has integrated a 
cadre of nutrition counselors into prevention of mother-to-child transmission of 
HIV programs, infant welfare clinics, and antenatal clinics to improve infant 
and young child feeding practices (IYCF). The study objective was to evaluate 
the effects of NIP's infant feeding counselors on exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), 
complementary feeding (CF), and children's linear growth.
METHODS: A cross-sectional evaluation design was used. Using systematic random 
sampling, caregivers were recruited from NIP sites (n = 359) and non-NIP sites 
(n = 415) from Infant Welfare Clinics (IWCs) in the Northwest (NWR) and 
Southwest Regions (SWR) of Cameroon between October 2014 and April 2015. 
Differences in EBF and CF practices and children's linear growth between NIP and 
non-NIP sites were determined using chi-square and multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: After adjusting for differences in religion, occupation, and number of 
months planning to breastfeed, children were almost seven times (Odds Ratio 
[OR]: 6.9; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.30, 21.09; β = 1.94) more likely to 
be exclusively breastfed at NIP sites compared to non-NIP sites. After adjusting 
for differences in occupation, religion, number of months planning to 
breastfeed, rural environment, economic status, attending other Infant Welfare 
Clinics, and non-biological caregiver, children were five times more likely to 
be stunted at non-NIP sites compared to NIP sites.
CONCLUSION: Training a cadre of nutrition counselors is one approach towards 
increasing nutrition human resources to implement nutrition interventions to 
improve maternal and child nutrition. In this research project, the study design 
did not allow for conclusive results, but rather suggest IYCF counseling 
provided by nutrition counselors was effective in increasing EBF and reduced the 
risk of stunting in children 6-8 months.",

relationship with birth interval (BI), and associated factors from 1996 to 2014.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the National Demographic and Health Survey of 
Peru (DHS) for the years 1996, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014 on children <5 years of 
age for stunting (height / age ≤ 2DS). The main independent variable of interest 
was BI dichotomized by interval between date of last and penultimate birth 
(≤24 months vs. >24 months) and others sociodemographic variables. Crude and 
adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated in logistic 
regression for the effect of BI and other variables on stunting by each survey 
year.
RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2014, stunting declined in both BI groups: ≤24 months: 
35.8% to 21.8%; >24 months: 29.5% to 14.3%. BI was associated with stunting 
after adjustment for other variables in each survey except 2005. Of the other 
factors, sex, birth order (fourth child or more), maternal education and poverty 
were independently associated with stunting in all survey years. Residence in 
rural areas and in Amazon forest and highland regions was associated with 
stunting 1996 and 2000. Maternal age was not independently associated with 
stunting.
CONCLUSIONS: While stunting showed a decreasing trend from 1996 to 2014, birth 
interval exceeding 24 months exerted a protective effect on stunting across the 
years surveyed. Poverty, low maternal education and high birth order were 
associated with stunting in all survey years.",

food supplements on anaemia and stunting prevalence in children aged 6-23 
months.
DESIGN: A controlled intervention study with measurements of height and 
haemoglobin levels, and cross-sectional surveys in August 2012 (baseline), 2013 
(mid-term) and 2014 (end-line).
SETTING: One intervention county and one control county in rural Qinghai 
Province, China.
INTERVENTION: Complementary food supplements (containing protein, fat, 
carbohydrate, vitamin A, B1, B2, B12, D3, folic acid, iron, zinc and calcium) 
and complementary feeding counselling were given in the intervention county.
PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers and their children aged 6-23 months.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect of the interventions on the 
prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin <110 g/L) and stunting (z-score of 
height-for-age <-2.0) (controlled for differences between the counties), and on 
infant feeding practices.
RESULTS: The surveys were conducted on 1804, 2187 and 2186 children aged 6-23 
months in the intervention county in August 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, 
and 804, 680 and 790 children in the control county, respectively. Between the 
baseline and end-line surveys, anaemia prevalence decreased more in the 
intervention county than in the control county (71.1% to 47.8% vs 86.3% to 
75.3%, respectively; p<0.0001). There was no difference in the decrease in 
stunting prevalence between the counties (9.7% to 7.1% vs 17.0% to 15.0%; 
p=0.7954). The proportions of children given iron-rich or iron-fortified food, 
introduced to (semi-) solid food at 6-8 months, and given food with minimum 
dietary diversity increased from 43.2% to 88.8% (p<0.0001), 81.4% to 96% 
(p=0.0470) and 53.0% to 59.8% (p<0.0001), respectively in the intervention 
county.
CONCLUSIONS: We found much higher anaemia prevalence in poor rural areas of 
Qinghai Province compared with the national data. Community-based complementary 
food supplements combined with dietary counselling can improve feeding practices 
and reduce anaemia prevalence. Future studies should use longer follow-up to 
assess the effects on stunting.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: We included a large number of participants and 
assessed a combined complementary food supplements and dietary counselling 
intervention in a poor rural area in China with high anaemia prevalence. 
Although the study took place in only one intervention county and one control 
county, we conducted an analysis that controlled for differences between the two 
counties. Also, although we made significant efforts to train village doctors, 
their education was not systematically assessed after training and thus their 
delivery of the interventions may have been variable.

219 million children aged younger than 5 years were exposed to stunting or 
extreme poverty in 2004. We updated the 2004 estimates with the use of improved 
data and methods and generated estimates for 2010.
METHODS: We used country-level prevalence of stunting in children younger than 5 
years based on the 2006 Growth Standards proposed by WHO and poverty ratios from 
the World Bank to estimate children who were either stunted or lived in extreme 
poverty for 141 low-income and middle-income countries in 2004 and 2010. To 
avoid counting the same children twice, we excluded children jointly exposed to 
stunting and extreme poverty from children living in extreme poverty. To examine 
the robustness of estimates, we also used moderate poverty measures.
FINDINGS: The 2007 study underestimated children at risk of poor development. 
The estimated number of children exposed to the two risk factors in low-income 
and middle-income countries decreased from 279·1 million (95% CI 250·4 
million-307·4 million) in 2004 to 249·4 million (209·3 million-292·6 million) in 
2010; prevalence of children at risk fell from 51% (95% CI 46-56) to 43% 
(36-51). The decline occurred in all income groups and regions with south Asia 
experiencing the largest drop. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest prevalence in 
both years. These findings were robust to variations in poverty measures.
INTERPRETATION: Progress has been made in reducing the number of children 
exposed to stunting or poverty between 2004 and 2010, but this is still not 
enough. Scaling up of effective interventions targeting the most vulnerable 
children is urgently needed.

Philippines, provided grants conditioned on health-related behaviors for 
children aged 0-5 y and schooling for those aged 10-14 y.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether Pantawid improved anthropometric measurements 
in children aged 6-36 mo.
METHODS: We estimated cross-sectional intention-to-treat effects using a 2011 
cluster-randomized trial across 130 villages-65 treated and 65 control-with data 
collected after 31 mo of implementation. Anthropometry characteristics were 
measured for 241 children in treated areas and 244 children in control areas. 
Health service use for children aged 6-36 mo and dietary intake for those aged 
6-60 mo also were measured. Outcome variables were height-for-age z scores 
(HAZs) and weight-for-age z scores (WAZs), stunting, severe stunting, 
underweight, and severely underweight. Impact also was assessed on perinatal 
care, institutional delivery, presence of skilled birth attendant, breastfeeding 
practices, immunization, growth monitoring and deworming, care-seeking, and 
children's intake of protein-rich foods.
RESULTS: Pantawid was associated with a significant reduction in severe stunting 
[<-3 SD from WHO standards for healthy children; β = -10.2 percentage points 
(95% CI -18.8, -1.6 percentage points); P = 0.020] as well as a marginally

change. Concomitantly, several measures of health-seeking behavior increased 
significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, Pantawid is one of few CCT programs worldwide

and stunting in children. Studies on recovery from stunting in India are even 
fewer. This study, thus, investigates the relationship between birth size and 
stunting in Andhra Pradesh, India. This study further examines the factors 
associated with recovery from stunting using a longitudinal data. Methods We 
used data from the three waves of Young Lives Study (YLS) conducted in Andhra 
Pradesh in the years 2002, 2006-2007, and 2009 respectively. We used data from 
1965 children in wave 1 to examine the association between birth size and 
stunting. For examining the factors associated with recovery from stunting 
between 1 and 5 years of age, and between 5 and 8 years, we use data from 582 
and 670 children who were stunted at age 1 and age 5 respectively. We use 
multivariable logistic regression models to fulfil the objectives of the paper. 
Results The children who were of average- or large- size at birth were 
significantly less likely to be stunted than children who were of small size at 
birth (OR 0.61 and 0.47 respectively). Children of average/tall mothers were 
0.41 times less likely to be stunted than children of shorter mothers. Severely 
stunted children were less likely than other stunted children to recover from 
stunting between 1 and 5 years of age, and between 5 and 8 years. Mother's 
height was statistically associated with recovery. Change in wealth status of 
the household was statistically associated with recovery between 1 and 5 years 
of age. In comparison, child immunization was associated with recovery between 5 
and 8 years. Conclusions for Practice This study contributes to the 
understanding of the impact of birth size on childhood stunting, and to the 
extent of recovery from stunting in India. Further follow-up is necessary to 
demonstrate the impact during adolescence and adulthood.",

by mucosal inflammation, reduced barrier integrity, and malabsorption, appears 
to be associated with increased risk of stunting in children in low- and 
middle-income countries. Fecal biomarkers indicative of EE (neopterin [NEO], 
myeloperoxidase [MPO], and alpha-1-antitrypsin [AAT]) have been negatively 
associated with 6-month linear growth. Associations between fecal markers (NEO, 
MPO, and AAT) and short-term linear growth were examined in a birth cohort of 
246 children in Bangladesh. Marker concentrations were categorized in stool 
samples based on their distribution (< first quartile, interquartile range, > 
third quartile), and a 10-point composite EE score was calculated. Piecewise 
linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between markers 
measured quarterly (in months 3-21, 3-9, and 12-21) and 3-month change in 
length-for-age z-score (ΔLAZ). Children with high MPO levels at quarterly time 
points lost significantly more LAZ per 3-month period during the second year of 
life than those with low MPO (ΔLAZ = -0.100; 95% confidence interval = -0.167 to 
-0.032). AAT and NEO were not associated with growth; however, composite EE 
score was negatively associated with subsequent 3-month growth. In this cohort 
of children from an urban setting in Bangladesh, elevated MPO levels, but not 
NEO or AAT levels, were associated with decreases in short-term linear growth 
during the second year of life, supporting previous data suggesting the 
relevance of MPO as a marker of EE.",

countries is common. Giardia is a ubiquitous pathogen in this age group but 
studies investigating Giardia's effect on both growth and diarrhea have produced 
conflicting results.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal birth cohort study in Dhaka, 
Bangladesh, with monthly Giardia and continuous diarrheal surveillance.
RESULTS: 629 children were enrolled within the first 72 hours of life, and 445 
completed 2 years of the study. 12% of children were stunted at birth with 57% 
stunted by 2 years. 7% of children had a Giardia positive surveillance stool in 
the first 6 months of life, whereas 74% had a positive stool by 2 years. The 
median time to first Giardia positive surveillance stool was 17 months. Presence 
of Giardia in a monthly surveillance stool within the first 6 months of life 
decreased length-for-age Z score at 2 years by 0.4 (95% confidence interval, 
-.80 to -.001; P value .05) whereas total number of Giardia positive months over 
the 2-year period of observation did not. Neither variable was associated with 
weight-for-age Z score at 2 years. In our model to examine predictors of 
diarrhea only exclusive breastfeeding was significantly associated with 
decreased diarrhea (P value <.001). Concomitant giardiasis was neither a risk 
factor nor protective.
CONCLUSIONS: Early life Giardia was a risk factor for stunting at age 2 but not 
poor weight gain. Presence of Giardia neither increased nor decreased odds of 
acute all cause diarrhea.",

6-23 months includes adequate dietary diversity, appropriate meal frequency, and 
continued breastfeeding. Mothers receiving antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal 
care (PNC) may adopt better IYCF. This study examined the association of ANC or 
PNC attendance with IYCF and child nutrition status. Methods A cross-sectional 
study was performed on 400 mother-child pairs in rural Nepal. Mothers were 
interviewed about their history of ANC and PNC attendance and IYCF; the height 
and weight of their children were measured. IYCF was measured with infant and 
child feeding index (ICFI) aggregating scores of dietary diversity, meal 
frequency, continued breastfeeding, and dietary variety. Lower ICFI scores 
indicated poorer IYCF practices. Multiple regression and logistic regression 
examined the association of ANC and PNC attendance with ICFI scores and 
undernutrition, respectively. Results Absence of ANC (β = -1.01, P = 0.011) and 
absence of PNC (β = -1.01, P = 0.011) were negatively associated with ICFI

children's growth and nutritional status in low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: We pooled records from 42 demographic and health surveys in 29 
countries. Data on maternal lifetime exposure to physical or sexual violence by 
an intimate partner, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were 
collected. We used logistic regression models to determine the association 
between intimate partner violence and child stunting and wasting.
FINDINGS: Prior exposure to intimate partner violence was reported by 69 652 
(34.1%) of the 204 159 ever-married women included in our analysis. After 
adjusting for a range of characteristics, stunting in children was found to be 
positively associated with maternal lifetime exposure to only physical (adjusted 
odds ratio, aOR: 1.11; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.09-1.14) or sexual 
intimate partner violence (aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05-1.13) and to both forms of 
such violence (aOR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.14). The associations between stunting 
and intimate partner violence were stronger in urban areas than in rural ones, 
for mothers who had low levels of education than for women with higher levels of

the affected women's children. Policy and programme efforts are needed to reduce 
the prevalence and impact of such violence.",

long period of time. Stunting is associated with adverse functional consequences 
including poor cognition, low educational performance, low adult wages, and poor 
reproductive outcomes. The objective of the study was to investigate spatial 
variations and factors associated with childhood stunting in Ethiopia.
METHODS: This study is a secondary data analysis of the 2011 Ethiopian 
Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total of 9893 children aged 0-59 months 
were included in the analysis. The Getis-Ord spatial statistical tool was used 
to identify high and low hotspots areas of stunting. A multilevel multivariable 
logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with stunting.
RESULTS: Statistically significant hotspots of stunting were found in northern 
parts of the country whereas low hotspots where there was less stunting than 
expected were found in the central, eastern, and western parts of the country. 
In the final model of multilevel logistic regression analysis, individual and 
community level factors accounted for 36.6 % of childhood stunting. Short birth 
interval [AOR = 1.68; 95%CI: (1.46-1.93)], being male [AOR = 1.20; 95%CI: 
(1.08-1.33)], and being from a male-headed household [AOR = 1.18; 95 % CI: 
(1.01-1.38)] were the factors that increased the odds of stunting at the 
individual level. Children in the age group between 24-35 months were more 
likely to be stunted than children whose age was less than one year [AOR = 6.61; 
95 % CI: (5.17-8.44)]. The odds of stunting among children with severe anemia 
were higher than children with no anemia [AOR = 3.23; 95%CI: (2.35-4.43)]. 
Children with mothers who had completed higher education had lower odds of being 
stunted compared to children whose mothers had no formal education [AOR = 0.42; 
95%CI: (0.18-0.94)]. The odds of being stunted were lower among children whose 
fathers completed higher education [AOR = 0.58; 95%CI: (0.38-0.89)] compared to 
children whose fathers had no formal education. Children whose mothers who had 
high a Body Mass Index (BMI) (≥25.0 kg/m(2)) were less likely to be stunted 
compared with children whose mothers had a normal BMI 
(18.5 kg/m(2)-24.9 kg/m(2))[AOR = 0.69; 95%CI: (0.52-0.90)]. Children from the 
poorest wealth quintile had higher odds of being stunted compared to children 
from the richest wealth quintiles [AOR = 1.43; 95 % CI: (1.08-1.88)]. 
Unavailability of improved latrine facilities and living in the northern parts 
of the country (Tigray, Affar, Amhara and Benishangul-Gumuzregions) were factors 
associated with higher odds of stunting from the community-level factors.
CONCLUSION: Stunting in children under five years old is not random in Ethiopia, 
with hotspots of higher stunting in the northern part of Ethiopia. Both 
individual and community-level factors were significant determinants of 
childhood stunting. The regions with high hotspots of child stunting should be 
targeted with additional resources, and the identified factors should be 
considered for nutritional interventions.",

vaccine responses in Venezuelan Warao Amerindian children vaccinated with the 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and to investigate whether 
saliva can be used as read-out for these vaccine responses.
METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort of 504 Venezuelan Warao children aged 6 weeks 
- 59 months residing in nine geographically isolated Warao communities were 
vaccinated with a primary series of PCV13 according to Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended age-related schedules. Post-vaccination 
antibody concentrations in serum and saliva of 411 children were measured by 
multiplex immunoassay. The influence of malnutrition present upon vaccination on 
post-vaccination antibody levels was assessed by univariate and multivariable 
generalized estimating equations linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: In both stunted (38%) and non-stunted (62%) children, salivary antibody 
concentrations correlated well with serum levels for all serotypes with 
coefficients varying from 0.61 for serotype 3-0.80 for serotypes 5, 6A and 23F 
(all p < 0.01). Surprisingly, higher serum and salivary antibody levels were 
observed with increasing levels of stunting in children for all serotypes. This 
was statistically significant for 5/13 and 11/13 serotype-specific serum and 
saliva IgG concentrations respectively.
CONCLUSION: Stunted Amerindian children showed generally higher antibody 
concentrations than well-nourished children following PCV13 vaccination, 
indicating that chronic malnutrition influences vaccine response. Saliva samples 
might be useful to monitor serotype-specific antibody levels induced by PCV 
vaccination. This would greatly facilitate studies of vaccine efficacy in rural 
settings, since participant resistance generally hampers blood drawing.",

systems to today's presence of childhood under nutrition and adult overweight 
and obesity in the Yucatan Peninsula. It first compares Height for Age (H/A), 
Weight for Age (W/A) and Body Mass Index (BMI) of children from three rural 
populations in Yucatan and Campeche, Mexico whose subsistence strategy had been 
altered to different degrees since 1970. It then compares BMI in adults, in the 
same regions, born before and after the alteration of their environment in the 
1970's. Children in the least disrupted zone were taller and had lower BMI than 
children in the other two, but were not heavier than children from the richest 
disrupted zone. Children in the poorest disrupted zone were shorter and lighter 
than the rest. BMI in adult men was higher in the two most disrupted zones only 
in those cohorts that grew up after the traditional agricultural regime was 
altered. It is concluded that disruptions of staple-based subsistence 
agriculture promoted a stockier phenotype in children and a tendency to 
accumulate body fat. Persistence of these conditions in the twenty first century 
has favored the coexistence of stunting during childhood with adults who easily 
become overweight.",PMID: 26987151 [Indexed for MEDLINE],

inflammation of the small intestine, is associated with stunting in children in 
the developing world. The pathobiology of EED is poorly understood because of 
the lack of a method to elucidate the host response. This study tested a novel 
microarray method to overcome limitation of RNA sequencing to interrogate the 
host transcriptome in feces in Malawian children with EED.
METHODS: In 259 children, EED was measured by lactulose permeability (%L). After 
isolating low copy numbers of host messenger RNA, the transcriptome was reliably 
and reproducibly profiled, validated by polymerase chain reaction. Messenger RNA 
copy number then was correlated with %L and differential expression in EED. The 
transcripts identified were mapped to biological pathways and processes. The 
children studied had a range of %L values, consistent with a spectrum of EED 
from none to severe.
RESULTS: We identified 12 transcripts associated with the severity of EED, 
including chemokines that stimulate T-cell proliferation, Fc fragments of 
multiple immunoglobulin families, interferon-induced proteins, activators of 
neutrophils and B cells, and mediators that dampen cellular responses to 
hormones. EED-associated transcripts mapped to pathways related to cell 
adhesion, and responses to a broad spectrum of viral, bacterial, and parasitic 
microbes. Several mucins, regulatory factors, and protein kinases associated 
with the maintenance of the mucous layer were expressed less in children with 
EED than in normal children.
CONCLUSIONS: EED represents the activation of diverse elements of the immune 
system and is associated with widespread intestinal barrier disruption. 
Differentially expressed transcripts, appropriately enumerated, should be 
explored as potential biomarkers.",

prevalence of chronic under-nutrition (stunting) in children.
AIM: The purpose of this paper is to explore the dual burden of infant and child 
(5-23 months) under-nutrition and maternal over-weight and obesity in the 
Western Highlands of Guatemala.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Anthropometric measures were collected in 446 
mother-infant dyads in a metropolitan population of mixed indigenous (Maya) and 
non-indigenous descent in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Children were 
identified as stunted based on a height for age <-2 below the WHO reference 
median and maternal overweight/obesity defined as a BMI ≥25. Stunted children 
with an overweight/obese mother were compared to other children who were not 
stunted and/or who did not have an overweight/obese mother.
RESULTS: The prevalences of stunting (38%) and maternal overweight/obesity (45%) 
were high, but just 17% of the mother and child pairs were dual burden. The 
socio-demographic characteristics of stunted children were not influenced by 
maternal overweight or obesity.
CONCLUSION: Policies are needed to address under-nutrition as well as preventing

and Health Surveys (2001, 2006 and 2011) was analysed. The primary outcome was 
stunting in children age <2 years. The main exposure variable was antenatal IFA 
supplementation. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis was performed. In our 
sample, 31% and 10% of Nepalese children age <2 years were stunted and severely 
stunted, respectively. The adjusted relative risk of being stunted was 14% lower 
in children whose mothers used IFA supplements compared to those whose mothers 
did not use (aRR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77-0.97). Additionally, the adjusted 
relative risk of being stunted was significantly reduced by 23% when antenatal 
IFA supplementation was started ≤6 months with ≥90 IFA supplements used during 
pregnancy (aRR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64-0.92). Antenatal IFA supplementation 
significantly reduced the risk of stunting in Nepalese children age <2 years. 
The greatest impact on the risk reduction of child stunting was when IFA

availability and dietary quality, and nutrition-related health outcomes.
DESIGN: A worldwide longitudinal modelling study using country-level data. Data 
on total dietary energy availability and dietary energy from 10 distinct food 
groups (as a proxy for dietary quality) were obtained from the FAO Food Balance 
Sheets database. Indicators of development were abstracted from the World Bank's 
World Development Indicators database. Data on nutrition and health outcomes 
were taken from the WHO mortality database and major cross-country analyses. We 
investigated associations of energy availability from food groups and health and 
nutrition outcomes in the combined data set using mixed effects models, while 
adjusting for measures of development.
POPULATION: 124 countries over the period 1980-2009.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years and 
mortality rate from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in adults aged 55+ years.
RESULTS: From 1980 to 2009, global dietary energy availability increased, and 
rates of child stunting and adult IHD mortality declined. After adjustment for 
measures of development, increased total dietary energy availability was 
significantly associated with reduced stunting rates (-0.84% per 100 kcal 
increase in energy, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.72) and non-significantly associated with 
increased IHD mortality rates (by 4.2 deaths per 100,000/100 kcal increase, 95% 
CI -1.85 to 10.2). Further analysis demonstrated that the changing availability 
of energy from food groups (particularly fruit, vegetables, starchy roots, meat, 
dairy and sugar) was important in explaining the associations with health 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that by combining large, publicly 
available data sets, important patterns underlying trends in diet-related health 
can be uncovered. These associations remain even after accounting for measures 
of development over a 30-year period. Further work and joined-up multisectoral 
thinking will be required to translate these patterns into policies that can 
improve nutrition and health outcomes globally.",

specialized nutritious foods are recommended to prevent acute and chronic 
malnutrition in young children. Among the available specialized nutritious 
foods, the World Food Programme and UNICEF recommend lipid-based nutrient 
supplements (LNSs) and Super Cereal Plus (SC+). Although the effectiveness of 
short-term distributions for prevention of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is 
well documented, evidence for long-term strategies and the role of distribution 
of specialized nutritious foods for prevention of stunting is weaker.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare long-term supplementation 
of LNSs and SC+ on the incidence of acute malnutrition and stunting in young 
children.
METHODS: We conducted two 15-mo-long supplementation interventions with the use 
of LNSs (500 kcal/d) and SC+ (810 kcal/d) and half rations during 5 mo of the 
nonlean season, for the prevention of acute malnutrition and stunting in 
children aged 6-23 mo. The study was designed as a prospective cohort in 11 
villages in Madarounfa, Niger. We compared the incidence of acute malnutrition 
and stunting with the use of Cox proportional hazards models and report on 
sharing and use of these food supplements.
RESULTS: Characteristics of children at baseline were similar across groups. A 
total of 1967 children were included in the analysis (845 in the SC+ group and 
1122 in the LNS group). No significant differences in the incidence of moderate 
acute malnutrition (SC+ compared with LNS: adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.61, 
1.02) or SAM (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.34) were found. No difference in the 
incidence of stunting (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.24) or severe stunting (HR: 
0.94; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.22) over the follow-up period were found.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings in young children in Niger suggest that both 
products should be considered when planning preventive distributions and choice 
of long-term supplementation should be guided by context-specific factors such 
as acceptability, cost, and operational feasibility, among others. Additional 
research is essential to improving child health. The study was registered at

especially growth. Limited information is available on the magnitude of zinc 
deficiency in Latin America and the Caribbean.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the latest available information on both the prevalence of 
zinc deficiency and the risk of zinc deficiency in Latin America and the 
Caribbean.
METHODS: The prevalence of zinc deficiency was identified through a systematic 
review looking for the latest available data on serum zinc concentrations from 
surveys or studies with national representativeness conducted in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. The risk of zinc deficiency in Latin America and the 
Caribbean was estimated based on dietary zinc inadequacy (according to the 2011 
National Food Balance Sheets) and stunting in children under 5 years of age.
RESULTS: Only four countries had available national biochemical data. Mexican, 
Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Guatemalan children under 6 years of age and women 12 
to 49 years of age had a high prevalence of zinc deficiency (19.1% to 56.3%). 
The countries with the highest risk of zinc deficiency (estimated prevalence of 
inadequate zinc intake > 25% plus prevalence of stunting > 20%) were Belize, 
Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines. Zinc dietary inadequacy was directly correlated with 
stunting (r = 0.64, p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence data from the four available Latin America and Caribbean

It is believed that both agricultural biodiversity and seasonal rainfall 
influences household food security and dietary intake. In the present study we 
aimed to study the effects of agricultural biodiversity and seasonal rains on 
dietary adequacy and household food security of preschool Kenyan children, and 
to identify significant relationships between these variables.
METHODS: Two cross-sectional studies were undertaken in resource-poor households 
in rural Kenya approximately 6 months apart. Interviews were done with 
mothers/caregivers to collect data from randomly selected households (N = 525). 
A repeated 24-hour recall was used to calculate dietary intake in each phase 
while household food security was measured using the Household Food Insecurity 
Access Scale (HFIAS). A nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) was calculated for each 
nutrient as the percent of the nutrient meeting the recommended nutrient intake 
(RNI) for that nutrient. A mean adequacy ratio (MAR) was calculated as the mean 
of the NARs. Agricultural biodiversity was calculated for each household by 
counting the number of different crops and animals eaten either from domestic 
sources or from the wild.
RESULTS: Dietary intake was low with the majority of households not meeting the 
RNIs for many nutrients. However intake of energy (p < 0.001), protein (p < 
0.01), iron (p < 0.01), zinc (p < 0.05), calcium (p < 0.05), and folate (p < 
0.01) improved significantly from the dry to the rainy season. Household food 
security also increased significantly (p < 0.001) from the dry (13.1 SD 6.91) to 
the rainy season (10.9 SD 7.42). Agricultural biodiversity was low with a total 
of 26 items; 23 domesticated and 3 from the natural habitat. Agricultural 
biodiversity was positively and significantly related to all NARs (Spearman, p < 
0.05) and MAR (Spearman, p < 0.001) indicating a significant positive 
relationship between agricultural biodiversity of the household with dietary 
adequacy of the child's diet.
CONCLUSION: Important significant relationships were found in this study: 
between agricultural biodiversity and dietary adequacy; between agricultural 
biodiversity and household food security and between dietary adequacy and 
household food security. Furthermore, the effect of seasonality on household 
food security and nutrient intake was illustrated.",

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,Viale delle Terme di 
Caracalla,00153 Rome,Italy.","There is increasing agreement among the nutrition community about the use of 
length/height-for-age as the indicator to monitor the long-term impact of 
chronic nutritional deficiencies. Stunting, an indicator of linear growth 
failure, has both long- and short-term consequences affecting growth and 
development and adult work potential. The number of stunted children in 
sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase by 2025 if the current trends remain. 
Stunting among African children peaks during the complementary feeding period, 
which coincides with the period when children are no longer on exclusive 
breastfeeding and infections are frequent. Addressing stunting has become the 
focus of global efforts. The World Health Assembly in 2012 set a 40 % reduction 
in the number of stunted children by 2025. To effectively address the issues of 
stunting in sub-Saharan Africa is it appropriate to examine the issue of what it 
takes. The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) conducted in several 
regions of the world, including Africa has lessons on what it would take to 
prevent in African children. The children in the MGRS had good socioeconomic 
background characteristics reflected by years of maternal education and 
availability of basic amenities, such as potable water and sanitary conditions. 
The prescription of exclusive breastfeeding, high-quality diversified diets and 
attention to care were critical factors contributing to healthy growth for the 
African children. Preventing stunting in sub-Saharan Africa is possible. It 
requires governments to put in place policies that would create the conducive 
environment needed. The complex and multiple causes of stunting offer the 
opportunity to address stunting in a multisectoral and within a food systems 
approach. The global resolve to make food systems deliver on healthy diet 
requires all stakeholders to work together to achieve the global goal of 
reducing stunting. This review highlights the key elements contributing to 
adequate growth in the Africa cohort of the WHO-MGRS and how these provide 
lessons for addressing stunting in children in sub-Saharan Africa.",

health facilities' catchment areas and travel times to health facilities. Travel 
time was found to be negatively associated with height-for-age z-scores at the 
5% level in a stepwise regression analysis that controlled for wealth index, 
mother's primary and secondary education, sex of the child, preceding birth

Overweight prevalence in excess of 60 % has been reported in some sub-population 
groups. Hypertension prevalence of at least 30 % has also been reported. 
Further, the prevalence of OWOB and hypertension in many SAC exceeds that of HIV

Baseline and 912 children at Endline and classified as: ""stunted,"" a 
height-for-age z-score less than -2; ""wasted,"" weight-for-height z-score less 
than -2; and ""underweight,"" weight-for-age z-score less than -2. Descriptive 
statistics and logistic regression using Stata 13.1 were used to examine factors 
associated with undernutrition.
RESULTS: Of children under age five years, 43% were undernourished in 2010 and 
55% in 2014. The most common form of undernutrition was stunting (39% in 2010, 
51% in 2014), followed by underweight (13% in both 2010 and 2014), and wasting 
(7% in 2010, 5% in 2014). Child's age was found to have a non-linear association 
with stunting. Vitamin A supplementation was associated with a 31% (p=0.04) 
decreased odds of stunting. Children who were exclusively breastfed for at least 
six months had an 80% (p=0.02) lower odds of wasting in 2014 and 57% (p=0.05) 
decreased odds of being underweight in 2014. Introducing other foods after age 
six months was associated with a five-fold increased odds of wasting in 2014 
(p=0.02); household food insecurity was associated with wasting (OR=2.08; 
p=0.03) and underweight in 2010 (OR=2.31; p=0.05). Children whose mother washed 
her hands with a cleaning agent had a 40% (p=0.05) decreased odds of being 
underweight. Surprisingly, per point increase in household dietary diversity 
score, children had 12% greater odds of being stunted in 2010 (p=0.01) but 9% 
decreased odds of being underweight in 2014 (p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of household and individual level factors was 
associated with undernutrition. As such, employment of multidimensional 
interventions should be considered to decrease undernutrition in children under 
five years old.",
221. MYCOTOXIN CONTROL IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES.,"Wild CP, Miller JD, Groopman JD, editors.",Lyon (FR): International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2015.,"This book provides an evaluation of measures to reduce exposure to highly toxic 
and carcinogenic contaminants in staple diets in Africa as well as parts of Asia 
and Latin America. Many of the poorest people in these regions are exposed to 
the pervasive natural toxins, aflatoxins and fumonisins, on a daily basis by 
eating their staple diet of groundnuts, maize, and other cereals. Exposure to 
mycotoxins at these high levels substantially increases mortality and morbidity. 
Aflatoxins are a cause of human liver cancer, and fatalities from acute 
aflatoxin poisoning outbreaks occur in Africa and Asia. The International Agency 
for Research on Cancer convened a Working Group of world-leading experts to 
review the health effects of aflatoxins and fumonisins and to evaluate 
intervention measures. The panel concluded that these mycotoxins not only are a 
cause of acute poisoning and cancer but also are a likely contributor to the 
high levels of stunting in children in affected populations. The Working Group 
also identified effective measures to reduce exposure in developing countries. 
The panel evaluated 15 interventions, considering the strength of the evidence 
as well as its completeness and its transferability at an individual, community, 
or national level. Four of the interventions were judged to be ready for 
implementation: improvement of dietary diversity; crop sorting; post-harvest 
measures, including improved storage; and, in Latin America for maize, optimized 
nixtamalization. These recommendations would be relevant for investment of 
public, nongovernmental organization, and private funds at the scale of the 
subsistence farmer, the smallholder, and through to a more advanced value chain.","© International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2015. For more information

Bobo-Dioulasso,Burkina Faso.","The nutrition landscape in West Africa has been dominated by the programmes to 
address undernutrition. However, with increasing urbanisation, technological 
developments and associated change in dietary patterns and physical activity, 
childhood and adult overweight, and obesity are becoming more prevalent. There 
is an evidence of increasing intake of dietary energy, fat, sugars and protein. 
There is low consumption of fruit and vegetables universally in West Africa. 
Overall, the foods consumed are predominantly traditional with the component 
major food groups within recommended levels. Most of the West African countries 
are at the early stages of nutrition transition but countries such as Cape 
Verde, Ghana and Senegal are at the latter stages. In the major cities of the 
region, children consume energy-dense foods such as candies, ice cream and 
sweetened beverages up to seven times as frequently as fruit and vegetables. 
Adult obesity rates have increased by 115 % in 15 years since 2004. In Ghana, 
the prevalence of overweight/obesity in women has increased from 12·8 % in 1993 
to 29·9 % in 2008. In Accra, overweight/obesity in women has increased from 62·2 
% in 2003 to 64·9 % in 2009. The age-standardised proportion of adults who 
engage in adequate levels of physical activity ranges from 46·8 % in Mali to 
94·7 % in Benin. The lingering stunting in children and the rising overweight in 
adults have resulted to a dual burden of malnutrition affecting 16·2 % of 
mother-child pairs in Cotonou. The prevalence of hypertension has been increased 
and ranges from 17·6 % in Burkina Faso to 38·7 % in Cape Verde. The prevalence 
is higher in the cities: 40·2 % in Ougadougou, 46·0 % in St Louis and 54·6 % in 
Accra. The prevalence of diabetes ranges from 2·5 to 7·9 % but could be as high 
as 17·9 % in Dakar, Senegal. The consequences of nutrition transition are not 
only being felt by the persons in the high socioeconomic class, but also in 
cities such as Accra and Ouagadougou, where at least 19 % of adults from the 
poorest households are overweight and 19-28 % have hypertension. Concerted 
national action involving governments, partners, private sector and civil 
society is needed to re-orient health systems and build capacity to address the 
dual burden of malnutrition, to regulate the food and beverage industry and to 
encourage healthy eating throughout the life course.",

status of South African preschool children from four areas with known distinct 
eating patterns.
METHODS: Serum retinol, anthropometric indicators, and dietary intake were 
determined for randomly selected preschool children from two rural areas, i.e. 
KwaZulu-Natal (n = 140) and Limpopo (n = 206); an urban area in the Northern 
Cape (n = 194); and an urban metropolitan area in the Western Cape (n = 207).
RESULTS: Serum retinol <20 μg/dL was prevalent in 8.2% to 13.6% children. 
Between 3% (urban-Northern Cape) and 44.2% (rural-Limpopo) children had received 
a high-dose vitamin A supplement during the preceding 6 mo. Vitamin A derived 
from fortified bread and/or maize meal ranged from 65 μg retinol activity 
equivalents (24%-31% of the Estimated Average Requirement) to 160 μg retinol 
activity equivalents (58%-76% Estimated Average Requirement). Fortified bread 
and/or maize meal contributed 57% to 59% of total vitamin A intake in rural 
children, and 28% to 38% in urban children. Across the four areas, stunting in 
children ranged from 13.9% to 40.9%; and overweight from 1.2% to 15.1%.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was lower than national figures, 
and did not differ across areas despite differences in socioeconomics, dietary 
intake, and vitamin A supplementation coverage. Rural children benefited more 
from the national food fortification program in terms of vitamin A intake. Large 
variations in anthropometric status highlight the importance of targeting 
specific nutrition interventions, taking into account the double burden of 
overnutrition and undernutrition.",

of the Republic (UdelaR), Montevideo, Uruguay (CS); and the Program for 
Nutrition, Ministry of Public Health, Montevideo, Uruguay (XM).","BACKGROUND: Uruguay is at an advanced stage of the epidemiologic transition; 
like other Latin American countries, it bears a nutritional double burden 
composed of undernutrition and overweight or obesity.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to estimate whether a double burden of nutritional 
problems exists in Uruguay and to identify if governmental programs and policies 
for nutrition take this double burden into account.
DESIGN: Existing studies were reviewed, and other data were processed 
specifically for the purpose of this article. Several data sources were used to 
include a broad, comprehensive population range.
RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting in children aged <2 y is 10.9%. There is a 
high frequency of obesity, which increases with age (9.5% in children <2 y old, 
18.8% in those aged 6 y, 20.4% in those aged 11 y, 26.6% in those aged 13-15 y, 
and 35.3% in adults). In addition, 13.8% of women start pregnancy underweight 
and the rate of obesity increases during pregnancy from 36.7% at the beginning 
to 46.5% at the end. Anemia is very frequent in the selected population we 
examined, as follows: 31% of children <2 y old and 20.9% of pregnant women in 
their third trimester. An obese mother with a stunted child are present in 6.3% 
of households; 1.9% of stunted children are obese at age 6 y and 3.1% are obese 
at the age of 11. Multiple logistic analysis applied to children <2 y showed an 
association between stunting and obesity (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.6).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that there is a nutritional double burden in 
Uruguay. This nutritional burden is similar to that of other countries in the 
region. This important public issue should be tackled, and it should be 
addressed in early infancy.",

some regions and subpopulations, whereas overweight and obesity have increased 
at alarming rates in all age and socioeconomic groups.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe the coexistence of stunting, anemia,

DESIGN: We estimated national prevalences of and trends for stunting, anemia, 
and overweight and obesity in children aged <5 y and in school-aged children 
(5-11 y old) and anemia and overweight and obesity in women aged 20-49 y by 
using the National Health and Nutrition Surveys conducted in 1988, 1999, 2006, 
and 2012. With the use of the most recent data (2012), the double burden of 
malnutrition at the household level was estimated and defined as the coexistence 
of stunting in children aged <5 y and overweight or obesity in the mother. At 
the individual level, double burden was defined as concurrent stunting and 
overweight and obesity in children aged 5-11 y and concurrent anemia and 
overweight or obesity in children aged 5-11 y and in women. We also tested if 
the coexistence of the conditions corresponded to expected values, under the 
assumption of independent distributions of each condition.
RESULTS: At the household level, the prevalence of concurrent stunting in 
children aged <5 y and overweight and obesity in mothers was 8.4%; at the 
individual level, prevalences were 1% for stunting and overweight or obesity and 
2.9% for anemia and overweight or obesity in children aged 5-11 y and 7.6% for 
anemia and overweight or obesity in women. At the household and individual 
levels in children aged 5-11 y, prevalences of double burden were significantly 
lower than expected, whereas anemia and the prevalence of overweight or obesity 
in women were not different from that expected.
CONCLUSIONS: Although some prevalences of double burden were lower than 
expected, assuming independent distributions of the 2 conditions, the 
coexistence of stunting, overweight or obesity, and anemia at the national, 
household, and intraindividual levels in Mexico calls for policies and programs 
to prevent the 3 conditions.",

pediatric patients. Inflammatory bowel diseases are often associated with weight 
loss and stunting in children. Moreover, weight and height deficiencies are 
often early symptoms. Initially, nonspecific or latent course of disease delays 
the diagnostic process. Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases can be 
caused by disorders of digestion and nutrients' absorption, intestinal loss, 
increased energy expenditure and appetite impairment. Nutritional deficiencies 
and inflammatory agents lead to disturbance of tissue metabolism - muscle and 
bone - and retardation of somatic development of affected children. Thus, 
deficiencies of muscle mass, bone mineral density and body height are observed. 
Insufficient normalization of somatic features may be the consequence of 
recurrent nature of disease and specificity of pharmacological treatment.

developed rapidly during recent decades in China, malnutrition continues to be a 
major public health problem. The aim of the present study was undertaken to 
assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with stunting and severe 
stunting under 3 years old in mid-western rural areas in China.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was carried out in 84 villages 
in mid-western provinces of China in 2010. A total of 1260 children were 
selected for nutritional assessment in terms of stunting and severe stunting 
using the new World Health Organization growth standards. Hierarchical logistic 
regression was used to examine the risk factors for adverse nutritional status.
RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting and severe stunting was 27.0% and 13.2% 
respectively. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that the risk 
factors for stunted children were province of residence, caregiver's education, 
child's gender, low birthweight and duration of exclusive breastfeeding (<6 
months). The risk factors for severe stunting in children aged 0-36 months were 
province of residence, caregiver's education and child's gender.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that malnutrition is still a major public 
health problem among children under 3 years old. The government should implement 
appropriate nutritional intervention strategies to help reduce the prevalence of

sensitive indicator of nutrition and health than is total height (HT) or sitting 
height (SH) in a sample of 109 triads of urban Maya children (6.0-8.99 years), 
their mothers, and maternal grandmothers from Merida, Mexico.
METHODS: From September 2011 to June 2012, the following factors were obtained 
from all participants: (1) HT, SH, and leg length (LL); (2) the sitting height 
ratio (SHR = [SH × 100]/HT), relative leg length index (RLLI = [LL × 
100]/height), and percentiles and z-scores of HT, SH, and LL were calculated; 
and (3) the percentages of stunting for children or very short ZHT for the 
adults, short ZSH, and short ZLL: HT-for-age, SH-for-age, or LL-for-age below 
the 5th percentile of the reference were calculated. Correlations were performed 
to examine the association between z-scores of HT, SH, and LL among three 
generations.
RESULTS: Stunting in children was 11% (short ZLL = 29%, short ZSH = 7%). Short 
ZHT was present in 71% of mothers (short ZLL = 54%, short ZSH = 50%) and 90% of 
grandmothers (short ZLL = 69%, short ZSH = 83%). Significant correlations in 
ZHT, ZSH, and ZLL were found in mother-to-child and grandmother-to-mother, with 
the strongest correlations for ZLL.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis for children and mothers. 
Based on ZLL, there is evidence that childhood and nutrition have improved 
somewhat for each younger generation. Persistent environmental adversity during 
growth resulted in growth deficits for LL and SH for the mothers and

(1)Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Faculty of 
Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 7 York Road, Parktown 2193, 
Johannesburg, South Africa.","BACKGROUND: This study is the second to investigate the association between the 
use of biomass fuels (BMF) for household cooking and anaemia and stunting in 
children. Such fuels include coal, charcoal, wood, dung and crop residues.
METHODS: Data from the 2006-2007 Swaziland Demographic and Health Survey (a 
cross-sectional study design) were analysed. Childhood stunting was ascertained 
through age and height, and anaemia through haemoglobin measurement. The 
association between BMF use and health outcomes was determined in multinomial 
logistic regression analyses. Various confounders were considered in the 
analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 1150 children aged 6-36 months were included in the 
statistical analyses, of these 596 (51.8%) and 317 (27.6%) were anaemic and 
stunted, respectively. BMF use was not significantly associated with childhood 
anaemia in univariate analysis. Independent risk factors for childhood anaemia 
were child's age, history of childhood diarrhoea and mother's anaemia status. No 
statistically significant association was observed between BMF use and childhood 
stunting, after adjusting for child's gender, age, birth weight and preceding 
birth interval.
CONCLUSION: This study identified the need to prioritize childhood anaemia and 
stunting as health outcomes and the introduction of public health interventions 
in Swaziland. Further research is needed globally on the potential effects of 
BMF use on childhood anaemia and stunting.",

study aimed to determine the association between dietary diversity and stunting, 
underweight, wasting, and diarrhea and that between consumption of each specific 
food group and these nutritional and health outcomes among children.
METHODS: A nationally representative household survey of 6209 children aged 12 
to 59 months was conducted in Cambodia. We examined the consumption of food in 
the 24 hours before the survey and stunting, underweight, wasting, and diarrhea 
that had occurred in the preceding 2 weeks. A food variety score (ranging from 0 
to 9) was calculated to represent dietary diversity.
RESULTS: Stunting was negatively associated with dietary diversity (adjusted odd 
ratios [ORadj] 0.95, 95% confident interval [CI] 0.91-0.99, P = 0.01) after 
adjusting for socioeconomic and geographical factors. Consumption of animal 
source foods was associated with reduced risk of stunting (ORadj 0.69, 95% CI 
0.54-0.89, P < 0.01) and underweight (ORadj 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.96, P = 0.03). 
On the other hand, the higher risk of diarrhea was significantly associated with 
consumption of milk products (ORadj 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.92, P = 0.02) and it was 
significantly pronounced among children from the poorer households (ORadj 1.85, 
95% CI 1.17-2.93, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a diverse diet was associated with a reduction in 
stunting. In addition to dietary diversity, animal source food was a protective 
factor of stunting and underweight. Consumption of milk products was associated 
with an increase in the risk of diarrhea, particularly among the poorer 
households. Both dietary diversity and specific food types are important 
considerations of dietary recommendation.",

effective than placebo in patients with advanced AIDS. Unfortunately, the lack 
of financial incentives and the technical difficulties associated with working 
with Cryptosporidium parasites have crippled efforts to develop effective

of drug repurposing candidates (the NIH Clinical Collections), with the hopes of 
identifying safe, FDA-approved drugs to treat cryptosporidiosis. Our screen 
yielded 21 compounds with confirmed activity against C. parvum growth at 
concentrations of <10 μM, many of which had well-defined mechanisms of action,

reductase inhibitor itavastatin as a potent inhibitor of C. parvum growth (50% 
inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.62 μM). Bioinformatic analysis of the 
Cryptosporidium genomes indicated that the parasites lack all known enzymes 
required for the synthesis of isoprenoid precursors. Additionally, 
itavastatin-induced growth inhibition of C. parvum was partially reversed by the 
addition of exogenous isopentenyl pyrophosphate, suggesting that itavastatin 
reduces Cryptosporidium growth via on-target inhibition of host HMG-CoA

water (agüitas in Guatemalan parlance) are given to infants and toddlers. 
Formative research has shown that the use of agüitas in early child feeding is 
deeply embedded in Guatemalan culture.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence and timing of the introduction of agüitas 
during early life in a low-income population of metropolitan Quetzaltenango in 
relation to stunting in children.
DESIGN: Responses from 456 mothers of children aged 5-23 mo were analyzed by 
using logistic regression to explore relations between linear growth (stunting), 
diarrhea, and age at the first introduction of agüitas.
RESULTS: A total of 358 of 456 infants (79%) were agüita users independent of 
sex or ethnicity. Of infants given agüitas, one-fourth of subjects were 
introduced to agüitas within the first 2.9 wk of age, and one-half of subjects 
were introduced to agüitas within the first 9 wk of age. Subjects introduced to 
agüitas before 2.9 wk of age were 1.8 times more likely to be stunted (95% CI: 
1.1, 2.8; P = 0.03) irrespective of ethnicity. Children who had ever been given 
agüitas were twice as likely to have also had diarrhea (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 
3.3) and more likely to have needed medical attention for diarrhea (OR: 2.1; 95% 
CI: 1.1, 4.2), but diarrheal experience was independent of stunting.
CONCLUSION: Because of the early introduction of agüitas and the high prevalence 
of stunting in Guatemala, longitudinal studies are urgently needed to clarify 
the causal relations. This trial was registered at Nederlands Trial register as 
NTR3273 for 5-mo-olds and Nederlands Trial register as NTR3292 for infants ≥6

tropical regions and are closely associated. Although anaemia aetiologies are 
known to be multi-factorial, most studies in malaria endemic areas have been 
confined to analysis of possible associations between anaemia and individual 
factors such as malaria. A case control study involving children aged from 1 to 
10 years was conducted to assess some assumed contributors to anaemia in the 
area of Bonconto Health post in Senegal.
METHODS: Study participants were randomly selected from a list of children who 
participated in a survey in December 2010. Children aged from 1 to 10 years with 
haemoglobin level below 11 g/dl represented cases (anaemic children). Control 
participants were eligible if of same age group and their haemoglobin level was 
>= 11 g/dl. For each participant, a physical examination was done and 
anthropometric data collected prior to a biological assessment which included: 
malaria parasitaemia infection, intestinal worm carriage, G6PD deficiency, 
sickle cell disorders, and alpha-talassaemia.
RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty two children < 10 years of age were enrolled 
(176 case and 176 controls). In a logistic regression analysis, anaemia was 
significantly associated with malaria parasitaemia (aOR=5.23, 95%CI[1.1-28.48]), 
sickle cell disorders (aOR=2.89, 95%CI[1,32-6.34]), alpha-thalassemia (aOR=1.82, 
95%CI[1.2-3.35]), stunting (aOR=3.37, 95%CI[1.93-5.88], age ranged from 2 to 4 
years (aOR=0.13, 95%CI[0.05-0.31]) and age > 5 years (aOR=0.03, 
95%CI[0.01-0.08]). Stratified by age group, anaemia was significantly associated 
with stunting in children less than 5 years (aOR=3.1 95%CI[1.4 - 6.8]), with, 
sickle cell disorders (aOR=3.5 95%CI [1.4 - 9.0]), alpha-thalassemia (or=2.4 
95%CI[1.1-5.3]) and stunting (aOR=3.6 95%CI [1.6-8.2]) for children above 5 
years. No association was found between G6PD deficiency, intestinal worm 
carriage and children's gender.
CONCLUSION: Malaria parasitaemia, stunting and haemoglobin genetic disorders 
represented the major causes of anaemia among study participants. Anaemia 
control in this area could be achieved by developing integrated interventions 
targeting both malaria and malnutrition.",

(stunting) in children aged 6-36 months over a 5-year period in a food-insecure 
population in Ethiopia.
DESIGN: We used data collected through an operations research project run by 
Save the Children UK: the Child Caring Practices (CCP) project. Eleven 
neighbouring villages were purposefully selected to receive one of four 
interventions: (i) health; (iii) nutrition education; (iii) water, sanitation 
and hygiene (WASH); or (iv) integrated comprising all interventions. A 
comparison group of three villages did not receive any interventions. 
Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at baseline (2004) and for impact 
evaluation (2009) using the same quantitative and qualitative tools. The primary 
outcome was stunted growth in children aged 6-36 months measured as height (or 
length)-for-age Z-scores (mean and prevalence). Secondary outcomes were 
knowledge of health seeking, infant and young child feeding and preventive 
practices.
SETTING: Amhara, Ethiopia.
SUBJECTS: Children aged 6-36 months.
RESULTS: The WASH intervention group was the only group to show a significant 
increase in mean height-for-age Z-score (+0·33, P = 0·02), with a 12·1 % 
decrease in the prevalence of stunting, compared with the baseline group. This 
group also showed significant improvements in mothers' knowledge of causes of 
diarrhoea and hygiene practices. The other intervention groups saw 
non-significant impacts for childhood stunting but improvements in knowledge

CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that an improvement in hygiene practices had a 
significant impact on stunting levels. However, there may be alternative 
explanations for this and further evidence is required.",

availability and food utilization--in South Africa.
METHODS: A systematic search of national surveys that used the Community 
Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) index to measure food security 
in South Africa over a period of 10 years (1999-2008) was conducted. 
Anthropometric data for children aged 1-9 years were used to assess food 
utilization, and household food inventory data were used to assess food 
availability.
FINDINGS: Only three national surveys had used the CCHIP index, namely, the 1999 
and 2005 National Food Consumption Surveys (NFCS) and the 2008 South African 
Social Attitudes Survey. These surveys showed a relatively large decrease in 
food insecurity between 1999 and 2008. However, the consistent emerging trend 
indicated that in poorer households women were either feeding their children a 
poor diet or skipping meals so their children could eat. In terms of food access 
and availability, the 1999 NFCS showed that households that enjoyed food 
security consumed an average of 16 different food items over 24 hours, whereas 
poorer households spent less money on food and consumed fewer than 8 different 
food items. Moreover, children had low mean scores for dietary diversity (3.58; 
standard deviation, SD: ± 1.37) and dietary variety (5.52; SD: ± 2.54) scores. 
In terms of food utilization, the NFCS showed that stunting in children 
decreased from 21.6% in 1999 to 18% in 2005.

insecurity and malnutrition. Poor nutrition contributes to more than a third of 
all deaths associated with infectious diseases among children under 5 years of 
age in developing countries. With increased household food insecurity, and a 
greater disease burden associated with HIV/AIDS, the growth of children under 
five could be impacted, resulting in increased malnutrition for this vulnerable 
group.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between the type of 
household (HIV-affected compared with HIV-unaffected) and the nutritional status 
of children under 5 years of age residing in these households.
METHODS: The study was set in a Millennium Village Project site in western Kenya 
and used a cross-sectional design to compare the stunting, wasting, and 
underweight status among 102 and 99 under-five children living in HIV-affected 
and -unaffected households, respectively. Height-for-age, weight-for-age, and 
weight-for-age z-scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization 
growth standards and compared. Proportions, means, and standard deviations were 
used to describe the data. The data were analyzed with the use of the chi-square 
test for comparison of proportions and the independent t-test for comparison of 
means.
RESULTS: Children in HIV-affected households had a significantly higher degree 
of stunting (height-for-age < -2 SD) than children in unaffected households 
(25.5% vs. 9.1%, p = .002). The degree of wasting and underweight did not differ 
significantly between HIV-affected and -unaffected households.
CONCLUSIONS: Residing in HIV-affected households is associated with stunting in 
children under 5 years of age.",

nutritional status of children in China during and after the crisis.
METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2010 were sourced from the National Food and 
Nutrition Surveillance System. Approximately 16 000 children under 5 years old 
were selected using a stratified random cluster method from 40 surveillance 
sites. Anthropometric and hemoglobin measurements for children under 5 were 
conducted. Nutritional status was determined according to WHO child growth 
standards.
RESULTS: Prevalence of underweight and stunting in children under 5 had a 
downward trend. Underweight prevalence was close to normal (less than 5%), with 
prevalence of stunting 12.6% in 2009 and 12.1% in 2010 in rural areas. 
Prevalence of stunting in infants under 6 months and 6-12 months old in poorer 
rural areas increased from 5.7%-9.1% and 6.7%-12.5%, respectively, in 2008-2009. 
This trend also continued post-crisis in 2010. Prevalence of stunting in 
children left behind by mothers was 20%-30% higher than in children the same age

multi-micronutrient supplementation on the growth of children during early 
childhood. In this follow-up study, the effects of maternal supplementation with 
multi-micronutrients in pregnancy on postnatal child growth are examined.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up of a subset of newborns (n=1388) 
whose mothers were randomly assigned to receive the supplements of folic acid, 
iron-folic acid or multi-micronutrients daily during pregnancy in the original 
trial was conducted. Children's weight and length were measured and assessed

iron-folic acid group and multi-micronutrient group, respectively. However, 
there were no significant differences in the pooled odds of stunting in children 
between the multi-micronutrient group and the folic acid (odds ratio (OR) 0.97,

to estimate the expected weight and height of children using age as a variable. 
The present study was undertaken to assess the validity of Weech's formulae in 
diagnosing undernutrition. We collected anthropometric information from 294 
consecutive children, aged 12-59 months, who visited a health centre. Age was 
calculated from birth records and was recorded in completed months as well as 
completed years. Weight and height/length were measured using standard methods. 
Weight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores were calculated using WHO Anthro. 
Weech's formulae were used to calculate weight-for-age (%) and height-for-age 
(%). A cut off of < or =80.0% weight-forage and < or = 95.0% height-for-age were 
used to evaluate the validity of underweight and stunting respectively; a cut 
off of < or = 60.0% weight-for-age and <85.0% height-for-age were used for 
severe underweight and severe stunting respectively. Weech's formulae were found

stunting (height-for-age Z score<-2). When evaluating severe underweight 
(weight-for-age Z scorc<-3) and severe stunting (height-for-age Z scorc<-3), 
Weech's formulae were found to be 100% specific but the sensitivity was very

differentiation and metabolism. The results of previous meta-analyses evaluating 
effect of zinc supplementation on linear growth are inconsistent. We have 
updated and evaluated the available evidence according to Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria and 
tried to explain the difference in results of the previous reviews.
METHODS: A literature search was done on PubMed, Cochrane Library, IZiNCG 
database and WHO regional data bases using different terms for zinc and linear 
growth (height). Data were abstracted in a standardized form. Data were analyzed 
in two ways i.e. weighted mean difference (effect size) and pooled mean 
difference for absolute increment in length in centimeters. Random effect models 
were used for these pooled estimates. We have given our recommendations for 
effectiveness of zinc supplementation in the form of absolute increment in 
length (cm) in zinc supplemented group compared to control for input to Live 
Saves Tool (LiST).
RESULTS: There were thirty six studies assessing the effect of zinc 
supplementation on linear growth in children < 5 years from developing 
countries. In eleven of these studies, zinc was given in combination with other 
micronutrients (iron, vitamin A, etc). The final effect size after pooling all 
the data sets (zinc ± iron etc) showed a significant positive effect of zinc 
supplementation on linear growth [Effect size: 0.13 (95% CI 0.04, 0.21), random 
model] in the developing countries. A subgroup analysis by excluding those data 
sets where zinc was supplemented in combination with iron showed a more 
pronounced effect of zinc supplementation on linear growth [Weighed mean 
difference 0.19 (95 % CI 0.08, 0.30), random model]. A subgroup analysis from 
studies that reported actual increase in length (cm) showed that a dose of 10 mg 
zinc/day for duration of 24 weeks led to a net a gain of 0.37 (± 0.25) cm in 
zinc supplemented group compared to placebo. This estimate is recommended for 
inclusion in Lives Saved Tool (LiST) model.
CONCLUSIONS: Zinc supplementation has a significant positive effect on linear 
growth, especially when administered alone, and should be included in national 
strategies to reduce stunting in children < 5 years of age in developing 
countries.",

characteristics associated with child stunting, maternal overweight and the 
familial coexistence of both types of malnutrition. In Guatemala, 2000, with 
nationally representative data, we selected 2261 households with at least one 
child aged 12-60 months and his/her mother. Nutritional status was assessed in 
children (e.g., stunting as height-for-age Z-score<-2) and mothers (e.g., 
overweight as body mass index > or =25 kg/m(2)) and identified the presence of 
both, child stunting and maternal overweight in the same household (SCOM). With 
logistic regression models we assessed the association of the malnutrition 
indicators with individual and household socio-economic and health 
characteristics. SCOM was identified in 18% of households. Socio-economic status 
(SES) of SCOM households was significantly lower than SES of households with 
non-stunted children. SCOM households, compared to those with normal-stature 
children and normal weight mothers, were more likely to have mothers of short 
stature (adjusted odds ratio-OR+/-95% CI=3.1 (2.1-4.7)), higher parity (1.2 
(1.1-1.3)), currently working (1.7 (1.1-2.6), and self-identified as indigenous 
(2.0 (1.3-3.1)). Factors associated with stunting in children such as poverty, 
maternal short stature and indigenousness, were predictors of SCOM. These 
findings support the notion that SCOM is an extension of the malnutrition 
spectrum in the most disadvantaged population groups in countries that are in 
the middle of their nutrition transitions such as Guatemala. At the same time it 
revealed that these populations are already in the stage of chronic, nutrition 
related diseases associated with less physical activity and more access to 
highly processed foods of low cost, high dietary energy and low nutrient density 
in important population groups. The challenge for the decision makers and 
service deliverers is to guide SCOM households to deal equally with both 
extremes of the malnutrition continuum.",

estimation. Despite the uncertainties regarding mortality trends, the analysis 
of health and social information from different sources offers clues to identify 
priority areas and key strategic directions for accelerating the achievement of 
the 4th Millennium Development Goal. Neonatal deaths represent from 40% to over 
50% of under five deaths in all these countries. Maternal mortality was above 50 
per 100,000 in 2005, despite the good coverage with antenatal care and births 
assisted by skilled birth attendants. The scanty information on quality of 
perinatal care indicates widespread substandard care at all levels. Stunting in 
children under five is above 10% in ten out of twelve countries and coexists 
with emerging overweight. Exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding fall short 
of what is recommended. There are important inequalities in child and maternal 
mortality, malnutrition and access and use of health services within countries. 
Taken as a whole, the available information clearly indicates that priority 
should be given to improvement of the health of women in reproductive age and of 
the quality of perinatal care, including the establishment of reliable data 
collection systems. To achieve this, action will need to focus on strengthening 
the capacity of the health system to improve the technical content of service 
provision, and on improving access and appropriate use of services by the most 
disadvantaged groups. The involvement of other sectors will be necessary to 
improve reproductive health and nutrition at community level and to tackle 
inequity. Comparisons between countries with similar socioeconomic background 
but different health policies seem to indicate that gradual progression towards 
universal coverage with essential health care through a national health 
insurance system is associated with larger reduction of child mortality than 
troubled transition towards a privatized and unregulated health system.",

the health and development offuture generations.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of prenatal multiple micronutrient 
supplementation on maternal weight gain during pregnancy, infant birthweight, 
and height of the child at around 2 years of age.
METHODS: We conducted a nonrandomized, non-blinded, side-by-side effectiveness 
trial in a normal program setting in three districts in the Red River Delta in 
the north of Vietnam. Women in one district received the standard iron-folic 
acid supplement during prenatal care; women in the second district received the 
multiple micronutrient supplement; in the third district, gender training was 
provided in addition to the multiple micronutrient supplement. Cluster surveys 
were carried out in the three districts at the end of the trial to verify low 
birthweight (LBW) and at around 2 years after the trial to measure children's 
height and weight, as well as to collect demographic data on the mothers.
RESULTS: Mean birthweight was higher in the districts receiving multiple 
micronutrient supplements than in the district receiving iron-folic acid 
tablets. The mean birthweight was 166 g higher in the district receiving 
multiple micronutrients and 105 g higher in the district receiving multiple 
micronutrients with gender training than in the district receiving iron-folic 
acid (p < .05). The prevalence of LBW children (< 2500 g) was lower in the 
district receiving multiple micronutrients (4.0%) and the district receiving 
multiple micronutrients plus gender training (5.8%) than in the district 
receiving iron-folic acid (10.6%) (p < .05). Children at around 2 years of age 
were taller in the district receiving multiple micronutrients (82.66 cm) and the 
district receiving multiple micronutrients plus gender training (83.61 cm) than 
in the district receiving iron-folic acid (81.64 cm), and the stunting rates

planners to develop nutrition programs and interventions in a post conflict 
area. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of and the 
risk factors associated with stunting and severe stunting among children aged 
less than five years in North Maluku province of Indonesia.
METHODS: The health and nutritional status of children aged less than five years 
was assessed in North Maluku province of Indonesia in 2004 using a 
cross-sectional multi-stage survey conducted on 750 households from each of the 
four island groups in North Maluku province. A total of 2168 children aged 0-59

revealed that the risk factors for stunted children were child's age in months, 
male sex and number of family meals per day (<or=2 times), for children aged 
0-23 months, and income (poorest and middle-class family), child's age in months

in children aged 0-23 months were income (poorest family), male sex and child's 
age in months and for children aged 0-59 months were income (poorest family), 
father's occupation (not working), male sex and child's age in months.
CONCLUSION: Programmes aimed at improving stunting in North Maluku province of

African countries, including South Africa. This study uses data from the Birth 
to Twenty study, held in Johannesburg, to investigate a range of household-level 
socioeconomic and social support predictors of stunting in children aged less 
than 30 months.
DESIGN: Logistical regression models were constructed using a conceptual 
framework to investigate the association between early life measures of 
socio-economic status and stunting (<--2 standard deviations from the WHO (2006) 
standard), using data collected in the Birth to Twenty study.
RESULTS: Stunting prevalence was 18.0% (213/1 186). In unadjusted analyses, 
numerous socio-economic status exposures showed significant associations with 
stunting; however, in final multivariable models, decreased likelihood of 
stunting was seen in children born to mothers who were employed (adjusted odds 
ratio (AOR) = 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.88), those with fathers 
who had completed secondary school (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.85), and whose 
parents employed a domestic worker (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83), while 
increased likelihood of stunting was seen in male children (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI 
1.03-1.91), and those born of low birth weight (AOR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.54-4.26).
CONCLUSIONS: Stunting and child malnutrition remain policy priorities for the 
South African Department of Health, and this study suggests that policies that 
aim to increase parental education level and reduce unemployment or target 
additional support to families with low education or unemployed parents may 
reduce stunting in preschool-age children in this setting.",

Illness (IMCI) strategy in the mid-1990s to reduce deaths from diarrhoea, 
pneumonia, malaria, measles, and malnutrition in children younger than 5 years. 
We assessed the effect of IMCI on health and nutrition of children younger than 
5 years in Bangladesh.
METHODS: In this cluster randomised trial, 20 first-level government health 
facilities in the Matlab subdistrict of Bangladesh and their catchment areas 
(total population about 350 000) were paired and randomly assigned to either 
IMCI (intervention; ten clusters) or usual services (comparison; ten clusters). 
All three components of IMCI-health-worker training, health-systems 
improvements, and family and community activities-were implemented beginning in 
February, 2002. Assessment included household and health facility surveys 
tracking intermediate outputs and outcomes, and nutrition and mortality changes 
in intervention and comparison areas. Primary endpoint was mortality in children 
aged between 7 days and 59 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This 
study is registered, number ISRCTN52793850.
FINDINGS: The yearly rate of mortality reduction in children younger than 5 
years (excluding deaths in first week of life) was similar in IMCI and 
comparison areas (8.6%vs 7.8%). In the last 2 years of the study, the mortality 
rate was 13.4% lower in IMCI than in comparison areas (95% CI -14.2 to 34.3), 
corresponding to 4.2 fewer deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% CI -4.1 to 12.4; 
p=0.30). Implementation of IMCI led to improved health-worker skills, 
health-system support, and family and community practices, translating into 
increased care-seeking for illnesses. In IMCI areas, more children younger than 
6 months were exclusively breastfed (76%vs 65%, difference of differences 10.1%, 
95% CI 2.65-17.62), and prevalence of stunting in children aged 24-59 months 
decreased more rapidly (difference of differences -7.33, 95% CI -13.83 to -0.83) 
than in comparison areas.
INTERPRETATION: IMCI was associated with positive changes in all input, output, 
and outcome indicators, including increased exclusive breastfeeding and 
decreased stunting. However, IMCI implementation had no effect on mortality 
within the timeframe of the assessment.

AIM: The present study examined the evolution of the nutritional situation 
(1997-2005) in Chilean schoolchildren as related to ethnical origin (Mapuche).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using official databases, stunting (height/age <or= - 2

(BMI >or=95 percentile) were ascribed in first-grade schoolchildren. Ethnic 
groups were assigned by native parents' surnames (none, one and two).
RESULTS: Based on 1 757 155 children (average age: 76.3 months), in 1997 
stunting reached 8.4%, 4.8% and 3.1% in children with two, one and no Mapuche 
surnames, respectively. In 2005 it fell to 3.7%, 3.1% and 2.6% - a marked

severe malaria and the resulting survival advantage are well known, the impact 
on the physical development in young children remains unclear. This study was 
aimed to investigate the relationship between HbS carriage and stunting in 
children below two years of age in a cohort from the Ashanti Region, Ghana.
METHODS: 1,070 children were recruited at three months of age and followed-up 
for 21 months with anthropometric measurements performed every three months. 
Incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by Poisson 
regression to estimate the association of beta-globin genotypes with the number 
of malaria episodes. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the association 
between the occurrence of beta-globin genotypes and/or malaria episodes and 
stunting. The age-dependent between-group and within-group effects for the 
beta-globin genotypes were assessed by population-averaged models estimated by 
generalized estimation equation with autoregressive correlation structure.
RESULTS: Analyses showed a significantly lower age-dependent risk of stunting 
(OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.33-0.96) in carriers of the HbAS genotype (n = 102) in 
comparison to those with HbAA (n = 692). This effect was restricted to children 
who experienced malaria episodes during the observation period suggesting that 
the beneficial effect of the beta-globin HbS variant on the incidence of 
stunting is closely linked to its protection from mild malaria episodes.
CONCLUSION: The lower risk of chronic malnutrition in early childhood, mediated 
by protection against mild malaria episodes, may contribute to the survival 
advantage of HbAS carriers in areas of high malaria transmission.",

RESULTS: Height/age and weight/height have increased over time (p< 0.05). Using 
WHO-2006 standards, stunting in children less than 5 years years old was 26.9%, 
21.5% and 15.5% in 1988, 1999 and 2006, respectively; values for wasting were 
6.2%, 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Wasting in the very young (< 6 mo) in 2006 is 
high (4.9%). Overweight increased from 1988 to 1999 (6.1% to 7.5%) and 
stabilized in 2006 (7.6%). Gaps among ethnic and socioeconomic groups have 
decreased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Stunting has decreased markedly but continues to be the main 
malnutrition problem. Overweight has emerged as a public health problem in the 
young. Lower NCHS/WHO estimates previously published underestimated true 
prevalence. Length deviations in attained height after 12 months indicate poor 
infant feeding practices, probably coupled with early infections. Results 
reinforce the need to improve the quality of nutrition programs and to promote 
adequate lactation and infant feeding practices in Mexico.",

Our aim was to ascertain major predictors of stunting in children <5 years old 
in Libya.
POPULATION AND METHODS: A nationally representative, cross-sectional, two-stage 
stratified cluster sample survey enrolled 4549 under-fives from 6707 households. 
Logistic regression was used to determine individual risk factors in bivariate 
and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Anthropometric measurements were available for 4498 children. Among the 
929 stunted children (20.7 %), 495 were boys (53.3 %) and 434 were girls (46.5 
%). In multivariate analysis, risk factors were young age (1-2 years: OR = 2.32, 
95 % CI 1.67, 3.22; 2-3 years: OR = 1.64, 95 % CI 1.22, 2.21), resident of 
Al-Akhdar (OR = 1.67, 95 % CI 1.08, 2.58), being a boy (OR = 1.28, 95 % CI 1.05, 
1.55), having a less educated father (illiterate: OR = 2.10, 95 % CI 1.17, 3.77; 
preparatory school: OR = 1.71, 95 % CI 1.11, 2.65), poor psychosocial 
stimulation (no family visits or trips: OR = 1.52, 95 % CI 1.07, 2.16; father 
rarely/never plays with child: OR = 2.24, 95 % CI 1.20, 4.16), filtered water

% CI 2.33, 81.72), diarrhoea (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI 1.09, 2.29) and low birth 
weight (OR = 1.8, 95 % CI 1.17, 2.40). Protective factors were older age of 
father (OR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.32, 0.90) and water storage (OR = 0.70, 95 % CI 
0.54, 0.90). These variables only explained 20 % of cases of stunting.
CONCLUSION: Various multilevel actions are needed to improve nutritional status 
of under-fives in Libya. At risk-groups include those with young age (1-3 
years), resident of Al-Akhdar region, boys, father's low educational level, poor 
psychosocial stimulation, poor housing environment, diarrhoea and low birth

gordon.shephard@mrc.ac.za","Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites of the fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. 
parasiticus, occur widely on many staple foods and cause a broad range of 
detrimental health effects in animals and humans. As a consequence, maximum 
tolerated levels (MTLs) have been legislated in many countries. However, in 
developing countries where food safety compliance can be low and significant 
levels of the food supply are locally consumed by the producers or purchased at 
local markets, more comprehensive strategies are required. In this regard, risk 
analysis with its components of risk assessment, risk management and risk 
communication, is an important tool in dealing with food safety issues. Risk 
assessment for aflatoxin B(1) in Africa has been performed using the 
carcinogenic potency, established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food 
Additives (JECFA) and applying it to typical food products and consumption 
across the continent, to illustrate the significant health implications caused 
by the intake of high levels of contaminated foods. Highlighted in this 
assessment is the fact that even low levels of contamination, which might of 
themselves fall within legislated limits, can have serious health implications 
due to high levels of consumption, i.e. meeting a MTL does not of itself 
guarantee food safety. Recent developments have highlighted the growth 
retardation and immune suppression caused by aflatoxin exposure in human 
populations in west Africa. Using the limited data available on both these 
health effects, a first step has been taken to incorporate them into a risk 
assessment paradigm quantifying the risk of immunosuppression, malnutrition and 
stunting in children exposed to aflatoxins and highlighting again how excessive 
consumption of foods meeting MTLs can carry significant health risks.",

395,122 families in Bangladesh as part of major nutritional surveillance 
programmes.
FINDINGS: The prevalence of stunting in families in Indonesia was 33.2%, while

observed stunting in this group of children may be a result of chronic 
undernutrition resulting in long-term growth faltering which is already evident 
at 1 year. Thus the observed phenomenon might be an adaptive mechanism adopted 
by children's metabolic processes as they grow up in an environment with 
inadequate essential nutrients due to poor weaning practices and consumption of 
a diet of poor quality, resulting in them gaining more weight at the expense of

vinod.mishra@orcmacro.com","BACKGROUND: Reliance on biomass fuels for cooking and heating exposes many women 
and young children in developing countries to high levels of air pollution 
indoors. Exposure to biomass smoke has been linked to reduced birth weight, 
acute respiratory infections, and childhood mortality. This study examines the 
association between household use of biofuels (wood, dung, and crop residues) 
for cooking and heating and prevalence of anaemia and stunting in children.
METHODS: Data are from a 1998-99 national family health survey in India, which 
measured height, weight, and blood haemoglobin of 29 768 children aged 0-35 
months in 92 486 households. Multinomial logistic regression is used to estimate 
the effects of biofuel use on prevalence of anaemia and stunting, controlling 
for exposure to tobacco smoke, recent episodes of illness, maternal education 
and nutrition, and other potentially confounding factors.
RESULTS: Analysis shows that prevalence of moderate-to-severe anaemia was 
significantly higher among children in households using biofuels than among 
children in households using cleaner fuels (RRR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.94), 
independent of other factors. Prevalence of severe stunting was also 
significantly higher among children in biofuel-using households (RRR = 1.84; 95% 
CI: 1.44, 2.36). Thirty-one per cent of moderate-to-severe anaemia and 37% of 
severe stunting among children aged 6-35 months in India may be attributable to 
exposure to biofuel smoke. Effects on mild anaemia and moderate stunting were 
smaller, but positive and statistically significant. Effects of exposure to 
tobacco smoke on anaemia and stunting were small and not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides a first evidence of the strong association 
between biofuel use and risks of anaemia and stunting in children, suggesting 
that exposure to biofuel smoke may contribute to chronic nutritional 
deficiencies in young children.",

children and aim to identify factors associated with postnatal catch-up growth.
METHODS: 1338 children born with a gestational age <32 weeks and/or a birth 
weight of <1500 grams were followed during a Dutch nationwide prospective study 
(POPS). Subgroups were classified as appropriate for gestational age and <32 
weeks (AGA) or small for gestational age (<32 wks SGA and > or =32 wks SGA). 
Data were collected at different intervals from birth until 10 years for the 962 
survivors and compared to reference values. The correlation between several 
factors and growth was analysed.
RESULTS: At 10 years the AGA children had attained normal height, whereas the 
SGA group demonstrated stunting, even after correction for target height (AGA: 
0.0 SDS; SGA <32 wks: -0.29SDS and > or =32 wks: -0.13SDS). Catch-up growth was 
especially seen in the SGA children with a fast initial weight gain. BMI was 
approximately 1 SD below the population reference mean.
CONCLUSION: At 10 years of age, children born very preterm AGA show no stunting. 
However, many children born SGA, especially the very preterm, show persistent

differing relationships to the tourist economy. Yucatec Mayan diets have become 
increasingly dependent on purchased foods, and reflect a greater consumption of

along with other local and internationally owned calorie-dense but nutrient-poor 
snack foods, is now a common element of Mayan diets, leading to what we call 
""coca-colonization."" The consequences of this diet, likely exacerbated by the 
increased consumption of snack foods, include an apparent increase in overweight

socioeconomic conditions. However, some families maintain adequate nutritional 
status in their children despite living in poverty. The aim of this study was to 
ascertain whether family-related factors are determinants of stunting in young 
Mexican children living in extreme poverty, and whether these factors differ 
between rural or urban contexts.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in one rural and one urban extreme 
poverty level areas in Mexico. Cases comprised stunted children aged between 6 
and 23 months. Controls were well-nourished children. Independent variables were 
defined in five dimensions: family characteristics; family income; household 
allocation of resources and family organisation; social networks; and child 
health care. Information was collected from 108 cases and 139 controls in the 
rural area and from 198 cases and 211 controls in the urban area. Statistical 
analysis was carried out separately for each area; unconditional multiple 
logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain the best explanatory model 
for stunting.
RESULTS: In the rural area, a greater risk of stunting was associated with 
father's occupation as farmer and the presence of family networks for child 
care. The greatest protective effect was found in children cared for exclusively 
by their mothers. In the urban area, risk factors for stunting were father with 
unstable job, presence of small social networks, low rate of attendance to the 
Well Child Program activities, breast-feeding longer than six months, and two 
variables within the family characteristics dimension (longer duration of 
parents' union and migration from rural to urban area).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the influence of the family on the nutritional 
status of children under two years of age living in extreme poverty areas. 
Factors associated with stunting were different in rural and urban

conclusions from the Mexican National Nutrition Survey 1999 (NNS-1999) and the 
principal nutrition policy implications of the findings.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The NNS-1999 was conducted on a national probabilistic 
sample of almost 18,000 households, representative of the national, regional, as 
well as urban and rural levels in Mexico. Subjects included were children < 12 
years and women 12-49 years. Anthropometry, blood specimens, diet and 
socioeconomic information of the family were collected.
RESULTS: The principal public nutrition problems are stunting in children < 5 
years of age; anemia, iron and zinc deficiency, and low serum vitamin C 
concentrations at all ages; and vitamin A deficiency in children. Undernutrition 
(stunting and micronutrient deficiencies) was generally more prevalent in the 
lower socioeconomic groups, in rural areas, in the south and in Indigenous 
population. Overweight and obesity are serious public health problems in women 
and are already a concern in school-age children.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of programs aimed at preventing undernutrition are 
currently in progress; several of them were designed or modified as a result of 
the NNS-1999 findings. Most of them have an evaluation component that will 
inform adjustments or modifications of their design and implementation. However, 
little is being done for the prevention and control of overweight and obesity

Enhancing food and nutrition security through innovative diversified agriculture 
and dietary practices, prevention and control of infection, promotion of food 
safety and fortification of staples with appropriate attention on emerging 
chronic disorders are essential. Population control measures to stabilize the 
fertility rates, biotechnological approaches for genetically modified foods, 
nutrition surveillance based on assessment, analysis and action to address the 
logistic, technical and compliance issues with emphasis on promotion of breast 
feeding and complementary foods with adequate attention on the reproductive 
needs of adolescent girls, pregnant mothers and lactating women would eliminate 
low birth weight, stunting, and chronic energy deficiency in vulnerable groups. 
Focused studies on bioavailability of micronutrients and its enhancement, 
innovative horticulture interventions, fortifications, social marketing 
strategies would promote the intake of micronutrient and phytonutrient rich 
foods. In-depth epidemiological research, an insight into foetal origins of 
adult disease and nutrition-genes interaction and life style alterations will 
avert the emerging epidemic of chronic diet related disorders. An investment in 
preventing foetal malnutrition improves nutrition of women in reproductive age, 
infant and child nutrition and prevents the onset of chronic disease in adult 
life. Human resource development, IEC measures, technology transfer, operational 
and logistic research, building of databases, integrated, intersectoral, 
multidisciplinary plans and sound management information system and surveillance 
with net working and experience sharing in the region will help to overcome the 
common challenges and lay the foundation for a better scenario in these regions 
in the near future.",

for age, sex, breast-feeding status and socioeconomic variables. We found that 
carotenoid intake was associated with a greater incidence of reversal of 
stunting. Children in the highest quintile grew 13 mm more during the study 
period than children in the lowest quintile [95% confidence interval (CI): 0-25

vitamin A intake was greater in infants up to 1 y old (RR = 3.3, CI: 0.9-11.7) 
than in children > or =3 y of age (RR = 1.0, CI: 0.8-1. 3) (P:-value for

from stunting in children. Dietary effects on growth might be strongest among 
very young children and those who have been most malnourished. Age, sex, 
breast-feeding status, socioeconomic status and severity of baseline stunting 
also were associated with reversal of stunting in this population.",

short stature, controlling for potential environmental confounders.
DESIGN: 1988 Mexico National Nutrition Survey.
SETTING: Mexico
SUBJECTS: The final sample size was 4663 pairs of children (<5 y) and their 
mothers (12-49 y) from a total of 13 236 surveyed houses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stunting (height-for-age Z-scores <-2).
RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting in children was 19%, and 10% of the mothers 
exhibited short stature (<145 cm). In the crude analysis, mothers with short 
stature were significantly more likely to have stunted children (odds ratio 
(OR)=4.0; 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.2-4.8; P-value <0.001). In a multiple 
logistic regression model the OR for child stunting was reduced, but remained 
significant OR=2.0; 95% CI=1.6-2.6; P-value <0.001) after adjustment for region, 
urban/rural residence, socio-economic status, household size, child age and 
presence of infection in the past 14 d, and maternal age, body mass index (BMI), 
and educational level. Adjusted ORs varied between regions (Mexico City, OR=3.9; 
North Mexico, OR=3. 1; Central Mexico, OR=2.0; South Mexico, OR=1.6. Comparison 
of crude vs adjusted estimates pointed to regional differences in the proportion 
of association between maternal and child short statures explained by 
environmental determinants.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal stature, reflecting her potential height and early 
environment, appeared to contribute to child height independently of the shared 
risk factors that could affect stature. Nonetheless, we could explain much of 
the association between stunting in children and maternal short stature by 
environmental factors, and part of the residual variability may be due to 
unmeasured determinants. Regional differences pointed to a predominance of 
environmental factors in explaining child stunting in poorer regions.",

Tlalpan, Mexico D.F., Mexico.","Recent studies have investigated the effect of micronutrient deficiencies on 
growth stunting, with special attention toward the effect of zinc, iron, vitamin 
A and iodine deficiencies. In Mexico, the prevalence of growth stunting in 
children <5 y old is approximately 24%; it is higher in rural areas and lower in 
urban areas. In an initial study, the effect of zinc and/or iron supplementation 
on linear growth was investigated in a longitudinal, placebo-controlled design. 
After 12 mo of supplementation, there was no difference between the groups 
supplemented with zinc, iron or zinc plus iron and the placebo group. At 
baseline, 82% of the children in this study were deficient in at least two out 
of the five micronutrients that were determined, and 73% were anemic. In another 
study, a mixture of those micronutrients that were documented to be lacking in 
Mexican children was formulated in a supplement and given to Mexican children 
over a period of 12 mo in a longitudinal, placebo-controlled, supplementation 
design. Children in the low and medium socioeconomic status grew about 1 cm more 
than similar children in the placebo group. This difference was not found in 
children of high socioeconomic status. It is suggested that, in most cases, 
growth stunting is associated with marginal deficiencies of several 
micronutrients and that in populations with multiple micronutrient deficiencies, 
the effect on linear growth of supplementation with single nutrients will not be 
significant. Supplementation with multiple micronutrients is expected to be more 
effective, but even in that case the actual increment in height was less than 
the expected potential increment.",

in Haiti, 8-10% in eight Latin American countries and 29% in Mexican Americans. 
Median BMI for Latin American women were near or above the 50th percentile of

greater in urban areas and in households of higher socioeconomic status. 
Overweight in children increased with higher maternal education; however, in 
some countries, obesity in women decreased with higher education. No general 
pattern of change over time was observed in eight countries in overweight in 
children. Obesity in women increased in the three countries with such data and 
in Mexican-American women and children. There was a tendency for greater

University Berlin, Germany.","Although the health and nutritional status of populations in many countries in 
the tropical and subtropical zones in Africa, Latin America, and Asia have 
improved considerably, nutritional problems and the burden of infectious 
diseases are still a major public health concern. This review presents the 
interrelationship between infections and the nutritional status of preschool 
children with an emphasis on ""protein-energy-deficiency"" on a community basis. 
Common nutritional indicators of subclinical undernutrition are the proportion 
of underweight, wasting, and stunting in children. These anthropometric 
nutritional indicators are also proxy indicators of the overall well-being of 
the child population. They reflect, in particular, the burden of infectious 
diseases on the community. Also in subclinical undernutrition, infectious 
diseases and often ill-defined spells of illness negatively affect nutritional 
status. A reduced nutritional status increases the risk of infections. 
Infectious diseases and undernutrition interact synergistically. In most 
countries, available resources are adequate to improve the nutritional status of 
the population and reduce illness spells; that is, if the population could be 
motivated to take health-related actions and have the active support of the 
health delivery sector on a community level.",

(1)Department of Human Metabolism and Clinical Biochemistry, Sheffield 
University Medical School, UK.","The field of bone cell biology is clearly of relevance to the problem of 
stunting in children, as in the final analysis the cells of the growing long 
bone are the ultimate 'regulators'. It is the alterations in the functions of 
these cells that manifests as a reduction in height. Normal longitudinal growth 
is achieved by the coordinated recruitment, proliferation, differentiation, 
maturation and eventual death of the cells of growth plate and bone. Cellular 
activity is closely regulated by endocrine factors acting directly or 
indirectly, with factors produced locally and stored within the bone and 
cartilage microenvironment having a critical role in intercellular 
communication. Disruption of any of these processes can lead to growth 
disturbances, since it only requires a defect in a single gene to have profound 
effects. Studies in recent years have shed light on the biochemical and 
molecular effects of cytokines and growth factors and have shown that these 
regulatory molecules may mediate the effects of certain hormones important in 
controlling growth. However, the complex interrelationship of these molecules is 
still not clear. Notwithstanding, understanding of the mechanisms involved in 
bone remodelling is increasing, as this area attracts much research because of 
the high incidence of metabolic bone disease in Western society. Although 
studies of adult bone remodelling are of relevance, there is a requirement for 
increased research directed specifically at the mechanisms of endochondral 
ossification and its regulation. Longitudinal bone growth is a challenge to the 
cell biologist, since it is an accelerated cycle of cellular division and 
differentiation, within which it is not easy to separate events temporally and 
spatially. In addition, different regulatory mechanisms are probably important 
at different stages of growth. Another difficulty impeding progress in this 
field is the lack of appropriate animal models for research. Much information 
has come from studies involving rodents, and species differences must always be 
taken into account. Larger mammals such as the growing piglet or the calf are 
probably more appropriate for the study of postnatal longitudinal growth in man. 
If the mechanisms of stunting are to be established at a cellular level, a 
number of approaches need to be considered. Studies need to be designed using 
more appropriate animal models, and conditions such as nutritional intake, 
immunological challenges, chronic intestinal diseases and mechanical loading 
need to be manipulated. Any effects on longitudinal growth may then be studied 
temporally and correlated with non-invasive measurements including assays of 
hormones, cytokines, growth factors and proteins known to regulate their 
activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

(1)Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.","A cohort of children in North-East Thailand was followed from birth to 2 years 
of age in an attempt to throw light on factors determining the development of 
stunting in linear growth. By 2 years the group as a whole had an average 
deficit in height of nearly -2 standard deviations. Those index children whose 
sibs were stunted had larger deficits than those with normal sibs. Their mothers 
were also shorter and lighter. These findings suggest that it is possible to 
think in terms of stunted families. No differences were identified in 
socio-economic factors and the prevalence of infection was in general low. 
Dietary intakes estimated by 24-hour recall, supplemented at 1 and 2 years by 24 
h weighing, were satisfactory for most nutrients except iron, calcium and 
niacin. Intakes of Ca and P were lower in the more stunted children. A number of 
variables were measured in urine and blood at 1 and 2 years but few 
relationships could be established with the degree of stunting. Excretions of 
calcium and phosphorus showed weak negative correlations with height. On average 
the serum concentration of calcium was satisfactory but that of phosphorus was 
somewhat low. Concentrations of somatomedin C, thyroxin and vitamin D were 
within reported normal ranges, with no relation to the degree of stunting. From 
a comparison of the linear growth of these children with the results of other 
reports from Thailand it is suggested that environmental factors have produced 
stunting in the cohort as a whole, but the cohort is essentially homogeneous, 
showing within it a normal range of genetic variation. If that is so, major 
differences in intake or biochemistry between the taller and shorter children 
would not be expected. The problem remains of why the group as a whole is 
stunted. This is the first systematic attempt to assess biochemical factors that 
may be related to stunting in Third World children; these results are 
essentially negative, although there are hints that point at a possible 
deficiency of calcium.",
