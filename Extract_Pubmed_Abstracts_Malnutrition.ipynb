These targets were extended to 2030, with all \\nof them remaining as originally planned, but the EBF one (increased to 70%), \\nwasting and overweight (both objectives set to eliminate them to negligible \\nconcern). Mexico is projected to achieve only one of the six nutrition targets \\n(wasting) by 2025, falling far short of the stunting, low birth weight, anemia, \\nand exclusive breastfeeding for the updated goals by 2030. This letter to the \\neditor describes the most recent prevalence of malnutrition among mothers and \\nchildren in Mexico. It discusses the challenges pregnant women and children \\nunder five years of age face exercising their right to good food, nutrition, and \\ndevelopment. The authors reflect on the urgent need to make structural changes \\nto achieve the global nutrition targets by 2030, highlighting the paramount \\nimportance of addressing the profound structural obstacles in Mexico and how \\nMexico's government must prioritize poverty reduction, reduce the marked \\ninequalities, enhance the quality of nutritional care and healthcare \\ninfrastructure, and implement climate-resilient agricultural practices to \\naddress this pressing issue.\\n\\n© 2024.

Samples of 2,937 Papuan children under the age \\nof two were gathered for the study. This study analyzed independent variables \\n(type of residence, mother's age, marriage, mother's education, employment, \\nwealth, child's age, gender, and early breastfeeding initiation (EBFI) with \\nstunting. The relationship was analyzed using logistic regression tests.\\nRESULTS: Stunting is more common among children in Papua's rural areas than in \\nurban (AOR 1.168, 95% CI, 1.128-1.209). Stunting is more common in children who \\nmother do not work than in mothers who do (AOR 1.174, 95% CI, 1.142- 1.207). \\nStunting is more common in children aged 12-23 months compared to children <12 \\nmonths (AOR 3.381, 95% CI, 3.291-3.474). Compared to girls, boys are more likely \\nto become stunted (AOR 1.348, 95% CI, 1,314-1,383). Children under the age of \\ntwo who do not experience EBFI are at higher risk than those who have (AOR \\n1.078, 95% CI, 1.050-1.106).\\nCONCLUSION: There are eight variables associated with stunting, namely \\nresidence, age of mother, mother's education, mother's occupation, economic \\nstatus, child's age, gender, and EBFI. Prioritization of stunting interventions \\nin Papua should be targeted at mothers who living in rural, having low \\neducation, and not doing early breastfeeding initiation.\",\n",

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 2 which seeks to ensure \\nthat hunger and malnutrition are reduced by 2030, it is imperative to ascertain \\nthe factors influencing their occurrence. This study examined the prevalence and \\nfactors associated with mother-child dyads of overnutrition and undernutrition \\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\\nMETHODS: Demographic and Health Survey data from 25 sub-Saharan African \\ncountries were used for the study. The sample was made up of 125,280 \\nmother-child dyads. Descriptive analysis was performed to determine the \\nprevalence of overweight or obese mother (OWOBM) with a stunted child \\n(OWOBM-SC), OWOBM with an underweight child (OWOBM-UC), OWOBM with a wasted \\nchild (OWOBM-WC), and OWOBM with any form of child's undernutrition indicators \\n(OWOBM-SUWC). Multilevel regression models were developed\\xa0to examine the factors \\nassociated with these indicators. The results were presented using an adjusted \\nodds ratio (AOR) with their respective 95% confidence interval (CI).\\nRESULTS: Higher likelihood of OWOBM-SUWC was found among women aged 45-49 [AOR \\n2.20, 95% CI 1.70, 2.85], those with primary [AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.21, 1.44] or \\nsecondary education [AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09, 1.35], and\\xa0divorced women [AOR 1.32, \\n95% CI 1.02, 1.73]. However, lower odds of OWOBM-SUWC were observed among women \\nwho were working [AOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76, 0.89] and those breastfeeding [AOR \\n0.75, 95% CI 0.70, 0.82]. The odds of OWOBM-SUWC was lower among females \\ncompared to male children [AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80, 0.90]. Compared to children \\naged <1 year, children of\\xa0all other age groups were more likely to have \\nOWOBM-SUWC. Other child characteristics significantly associated with OWOBM-SUWC \\nwere low birth weight [AOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.32, 1.71], having diarrhea [AOR 1.13, \\n95% CI 1.04, 1.24], and higher birth order [AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13, 1.66]. \\nChildren whose mothers used unimproved toilet facilities [AOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83, \\n0.98], those who lived in\\xa0rural\\xa0areas [AOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71, 0.87], \\nand\\xa0children from the Central [AOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.46, 0.65], Eastern [AOR 0.44, \\n95% CI 0.38, 0.52] and Western [AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65, 0.89] sub-Saharan Africa \\nwere less likely to have OWOBM-SUWC.\\nCONCLUSION: Combination of child, maternal, and contextual factors could\\xa0explain \\nmother-child dyads of overnutrition and undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. \\nAddressing this situation requires multidimensional policies and interventions \\nthat empower women through education and economic engagement. The observed \\nsub-regional differences in policies and commitments related to addressing \\nmalnutrition suggest the need for comprehensive and coordinated efforts to \\nimplement and strengthen multisectoral comprehensive nutrition plans across \\nsub-Saharan Africa. Sharing best practices and lessons learned can help improve \\nthe effectiveness and comprehensiveness of nutrition interventions and \\ncontribute to reducing the prevalence of malnutrition.\\n\\n© 2023.

More recently, Ethiopia faced a rising \\nproblem of the double burden of malnutrition-where a mother may be \\noverweight/obese, and a child is stated as having undernutrition (i.e., \\nstunting, wasting, or underweight) under the same roof. The burden of double \\nburden of malnutrition (DBM) and its association with maternal height are not \\nyet fully understood in low-income countries including Ethiopia. The current \\nanalysis sought: (a) to determine the prevalence of double burden of \\nmalnutrition (i.e., overweight/obese mother paired with her child having one \\nform of undernutrition) and (b) to examine the associations between the double \\nburden of malnutrition and maternal height among mother-child pairs in Ethiopia.\\nMETHODS: We used population-representative cross-sectional pooled data from four \\nrounds of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS), conducted between \\n2000 and 2016. In our analysis, we included children aged 0-59\\xa0months born to \\nmothers aged 15-49\\xa0years. A total of 33,454 mother-child pairs from four waves \\nof EDHS were included in this study. The burden of DBM was the primary outcome, \\nwhile the maternal stature was the exposure of interest. Anthropometric data \\nwere collected from children and their mothers. Height-for-age (HFA), \\nweight-for-height (WFH), and weight-for-age (WFA) z-scores\\u2009<\\u2009-\\u20092 SD were \\ncalculated and classified as stunted, wasting, and underweight, respectively. \\nThe association between the double burden of malnutrition and maternal stature \\nwas examined using hierarchical multilevel modeling.\\nRESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of the double burden of malnutrition was 1.52% \\n(95% CI 1.39-1.65). The prevalence of overweight/obese mothers and stunted \\nchildren was 1.31% (95% CI 1.19-1.44), for overweight/obese mothers and wasted \\nchildren, it was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.28), and for overweight/obese mothers and \\nunderweight children, it was 0.58% (95% CI 0.51-0.66). Children whose mothers \\nhad tall stature (height\\u2009≥\\u2009155.0\\xa0cm) were more likely to be in the double burden \\nof malnutrition dyads than children whose mothers' height ranged from 145 to \\n155\\xa0cm (AOR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.80). Similarly, the odds of the double burden \\nof malnutrition was 2.98 times higher for children whose mothers had short \\nstature (height\\u2009<\\u2009145.0\\xa0cm) (AOR: 2.98, 95% CI 1.52-5.86) compared to those \\nwhose mothers had tall stature.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of double burden of malnutrition among \\nmother-child pairs in Ethiopia was less than 2%. Mothers with short stature were \\nmore likely to suffer from the double burden of malnutrition. As a result, \\nnutrition interventions targeting households' level double burden of \\nmalnutrition should focus on mothers with short stature to address the \\nnutritional problem of mother and their children, which also has long-term and \\nintergenerational benefits.\\n\\n© 2023.

Though great progress has been made in measles \\nelimination, the resurgence of measles has been observed in recent years. As \\nextant literature were mainly confined to data of local area, we conducted a \\nsystematic analysis to explore the trends of the incidence of measles, coverage \\nrate, and the risk factors from 1990 to 2019 on global, regional, and national \\nlevels.\\nMETHODS: Data on cases of incidence, age standardized rate (ASR), vaccine \\ncoverage, and risk factors of measles were retrieved from the Global Burden of \\nDisease (GBD) Study 2019 database. Estimated averaged percentage change (EAPC) \\nof ASR was calculated to quantify the trends of measles incidence. Pearson \\ncorrelation was applied to assess the association of EAPC and measles-containing \\nvaccine coverage rate with socio-demographic index (SDI) in 2019, and the \\ncorrelation between ASR and measles-containing vaccine coverage rate.\\nRESULTS: Globally, there was a significant decrease in the number (84.18%) and \\nASR (6.13%, 95% CI: 5.41-6.84%) of measles incidence from 1990 to 2019. More \\nthan 80% of incidence cases were attributed to children under 5 and the \\nproportion was highest in low SDI region. Countries and territories with low \\nASRs are mostly clustered in North America, Southern Latin America, and Western \\nEurope, whereas those with high ASRs are mainly clustered in Africa, East Asia, \\nand South Asia. Lower SDI was associated with higher ASR and lower vaccine \\ncoverage rate. The more the SDI value was further away from 0.6, the smaller the \\nabsolute value did EAPC have. Child wasting accounted for the most \\nmeasles-related death cases, followed by child underweight, child stunting, and \\nvitamin A deficiency.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Measles eradication is feasible, but urgently demands political \\ncommitment, financial support, and public engagement. In the context of COVID-19 \\npandemic and the global resurgence of measles, surveillance systems and routine \\nimmunization programs should be improved, while vaccine hesitancy needs to be \\naddressed.\\n\\nCopyright © 2022 Wang, Jing, Liu and Liu.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3389/fmed.2021.798031\\nPMCID: PMC8810814\\nPMID: 35127753\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \\nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \\nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.',\n",

This study aimed to determine the \\nassociation between women's empowerment and growth faltering in under-5 children \\nin Ethiopia.\\nMETHODS: The data source for this analysis is the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and \\nHealth Survey (EDHS): a nationally representative household survey on \\nhealthcare. The EDHS employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. \\nWe computed standard women's empowerment indices, following the Survey-based \\nWomen's emPowERment index approach. A multilevel logistic regression model that \\naccounted for cluster-level random effects was used to estimate the association \\nbetween women's empowerment and child growth faltering (stunting, wasting and \\nunderweight).\\nRESULTS: Attitude to violence, social independence, and decision-making were the \\nthree domains of women's empowerment that were associated with child growth \\nfaltering. One standard deviation increase in each domain of empowerment was \\nassociated with a reduction in the odds of stunting: attitude towards violence \\n(AOR\\u2009=\\u20090.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.96; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), social independence (AOR\\u2009=\\u20090.95; 95% \\nCI 0.89-0.99; p\\u2009=\\u20090.049), and decision-making (AOR\\u2009=\\u20090.93; 95% CI 0.87-0.99; \\np\\u2009=\\u20090.023). Similarly, each standard deviation increase in attitude towards \\nviolence (AOR\\u2009=\\u20090.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.98; p\\u2009=\\u20090.008), social independence \\n(AOR\\u2009=\\u20090.91; 95% CI 0.86-0.97; p\\u2009=\\u20090.002), and decision-making (AOR\\u2009=\\u20090.92; 95% \\nCI 0.86-0.99; p\\u2009=\\u20090.020) were associated with a decrease in the odds of having \\nunderweight child.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Ensuring women's empowerment both in the household and in the \\ncommunity could have the potential to decrease stunting and underweight in a \\nrapidly developing country like Ethiopia. Policymakers and health professionals \\nneed to consider women's empowerment in this unique context to improve \\nnutritional outcomes for children and alleviate growth faltering.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1186/s12905-021-01183-x\\nPMCID: PMC7847175\\nPMID: 33516229 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declared that they have no competing \\ninterests.\",\n",

The 2016 \\nEthiopia Demographic and Health Survey report showed that the prevalence of \\nanemia among children 6-59 months of age was 57%; far exceeding the national \\ntarget of 25% set for 2015. Although studies have been conducted in Ethiopia, \\nmultilevel analysis has rarely been used to identify factors associated with \\nanemia among children. Therefore, this study aimed to identify individual and \\ncommunity-level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age \\nby fitting a multilevel logistic regression model.\\nMETHODS: The data was obtained from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health \\nSurvey, conducted from January to June 2016, and downloaded from the website \\nhttp://www.DHSprogram.com. The sample was taken using two-stage stratified \\nsampling. In stage one, 645 Enumeration Areas and in stage two 28 households per \\nEnumeration Area were selected. A sample of 7790 children 6-59 months of age was \\nincluded. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14. A multilevel logistic \\nregression model was fitted and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence \\ninterval was obtained.\\nRESULT: From the individual-level factors, anemia was associated most strongly \\nwith child age, wealth index, maternal anemia and child stunting followed by \\nchild underweight, child fever and birth order whereas from the community-level, \\nthe strongest odds of anemia occurred among children from Somali, Harari, Dire \\nDawa and Afar region followed by Oromia and Addis Ababa. Low community-poverty \\nis a protective factor for anemia. The odds of anemia were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, \\n0.99) times lower for children who were living in communities of lower poverty \\nstatus than children who were living in communities of higher poverty status. \\nChildren from Somali and Dire Dawa had 3.38 (95% CI: 3.25, 5.07) and 2.22 (95% \\nCI: 1.42, 3.48) times higher odds of anemia, respectively than children from the \\nTigray region.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that anemia among children 6-59 months of age is \\naffected both by the individual and community level factors. It is better to \\nstrengthen the strategies of early detection and management of stunted and \\nunderweight children. At the same time, interventions should be strengthened to \\naddress maternal anemia, child fever and poverty, specifically targeting regions \\nidentified to have a high risk of anemia.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0241720\\nPMCID: PMC7665792\\nPMID: 33186370 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competing \\ninterests exist.',\n",

For the present study, we \\ndefined it as the coexistence of overweight or obesity in the mother, and at \\nleast one child under the age of 5 undernourished, within the same household. \\nAlthough underweight has long been considered a major issue in South and \\nSoutheast Asia, overweight and obesity have also been identified as a growing \\nproblem. The main aim of this study was to assess the DBM at the household level \\nand its major determinants in South and Southeast Asia.\\nMETHODS: We used population-representative cross-sectional data from the \\nDemographic and Health Survey, conducted between 2007 and 2017, for eight South \\nand Southeast Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Myanmar, \\nTimor, Maldives, and Cambodia. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to \\nidentify the sociodemographic factors associated with DBM.\\nRESULTS: A total of 798,961 households were included in this study. The pooled \\nprevalence of overweight or obesity for the mother and stunted child was 10.0% \\n(95% CI: 8.0.0-12.0), for OBM and wasted child, it was 7.0% (95% confidence \\ninterval (CI): 6.0-8.0), and for overweight or obese mother (OBM) and \\nunderweight child, it was 7.0% (95% CI: 6.0-8.0). The prevalence of any of these \\nDBM coexistences was 12.0% (95% CI: 10.0-13.0) in all households. Statistically \\nsignificant positive associations (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) were found for each of these \\ncoexistences, and a higher age of the mother, mothers with a lower education, \\nthe richest household quintile, and households with more than four members.\\nCONCLUSION: It is imperative that \"double duty\" action policies are developed \\nthat tackle the DBM, rather than targeting undernutrition or overnutrition \\nseparately. The findings from this study suggest that the promotion of education \\nfor women may aid in tackling the double burden on a household level.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1038/s41430-020-00726-z\\nPMID: 32879448 [Indexed for MEDLINE]',\n",

A \\nweighted sample of 7830 mother-child pairs was analysed. The children's \\nnutritional status was determined using the WHO 2006 reference standards while \\nmaternal nutritional status was determined with BMI.

The \\nproportion of overweight and obese mothers was 26\\xa0% (18·8\\xa0% overweight and 7·2\\xa0% \\nobese). The prevalence of child stunting, underweight and wasting was 26·3, 12·8 \\nand 5·1\\xa0%, respectively. Out of the overweight/obese mothers (weighted n 2034), \\n20\\xa0% had stunted children, 5·4\\xa0% underweight children and 3·1\\xa0% wasted children. \\nOverweight/obese mother-stunted child pairs and overweight/obese \\nmother-underweight child pairs were less likely to occur in the rural areas \\n(adjusted OR (aOR) = 0·43; P < 0·01) in comparison with those residing in the \\nurban areas (aOR = 0·54; P = 0·01). Children aged more than 6 months were more \\nlikely to be in the double burden dyads compared with children below 6 months of \\nage (P < 0·01). The double burden mother-child dyads were more likely to be \\nobserved in wealthier households. Mother-child double burden is a notable public \\nhealth problem in Kenya.

Early-life malnutrition has been shown to \\naffect long-term health and income. One hypothesized channel linking early-life \\nmalnutrition and long-term outcomes is cognitive development. However, there is \\nlimited empirical evidence on the relationship between nutritional status and \\ncognitive achievement in middle childhood.\\nSTUDY DESIGN: As part of the South India Community Health Study (SICHS), we \\ncollected educational attainment and anthropometric data from 1,194 children in \\nrural Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, India, and assessed their math and reading \\nskills. We analyzed the relationship between continuous and binary \\nanthropometric measures of nutritional status and three measures of cognitive \\nachievement (reading, math, and grade level), adjusting for potential \\nconfounders, using a regression framework.\\nRESULTS: Lower height-for-age and weight-for-age and their corresponding binary \\nmeasures (stunting, underweight) were associated with lower reading scores, \\nlower math scores, and lower grade level, with the exception of the association \\nbetween weight-for-age and reading, which was marginally significant.

We aimed to comprehensively assess \\ndistrict-level geographical disparities and determinants of nutritional status \\n(stunting, wasting, or underweight) among women and children in Afghanistan.\\nMETHODS: The study used individualised data from the recent Afghanistan National \\nNutrition Survey 2013. Outcome variables were based on growth and weight \\nanthropometry data, which we analysed linearly as Z scores and as dichotomous \\ncategories. We analysed data from a total of almost 14\\u2008000 index mother-child \\npairs using Bayesian spatial and generalised least squares regression models \\naccounting for the complex survey design.\\nFINDINGS: We noted that childhood stunting, underweight, and combined stunting \\nand wasting were consistently highest in districts in Farah, Nangarhar, \\nNuristan, Kunar, Paktia, and Badakhshan provinces. District prevalence ranged \\nfrom 4% to 84% for childhood stunting and 5% to 66% for underweight. Child \\nwasting exceeded 20% in central and high-conflict regions that bordered Pakistan \\nincluding east, southeast, and south. Among mothers, dual burden of underweight \\nand overweight or obesity existed in districts of north, northeast, central, and \\ncentral highlands (prevalence of 15-20%). Linear growth and weight of children \\nwere independently associated with household wealth, maternal literacy, maternal \\nanthropometry, child age, food security, geography, and improved hygiene and \\nsanitation conditions. The mother's body-mass index was determined by many of \\nthe same factors, in addition to ethnolinguistic status and parity. Younger \\nmothers (<20 years old) were more underweight and shorter than older mothers \\n(aged 20-49 years).\\nINTERPRETATION: Afghanistan's rapidly changing political, socioeconomic, and \\ninsecurity landscape has both direct and indirect implications on population \\nnutrition. Novel evidence from our study can be used to understand these \\nmultifactorial determinants and to identify granular disparities for local level \\ntracking, planning, and implementation of nutritional interventions.\\nFUNDING: None.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018 The Author(s).

The problem of \\nchild underweight and stunting had been significantly resolved in China. Female \\nchildren had better outcomes than male children on improving nutritional status. \\nAmong all the non-socio-economic determinants of child malnutrition, children \\nwith low height mother and children had inadequate protein intake were both risk \\nfactors of malnutrition.

Less \\nenergy-demanding physical activities, in contrast, may yield psychosocial and \\ncognitive benefits while not overburdening an underweight child's already scarce \\nenergy supply.\\nCONCLUSIONS: While further research is required to establish the extent to which \\nincreases in energy-demanding physical activities may compromise or displace \\nenergy available for brain development, we argue that action cannot await these \\nfindings.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1123/jpah.2015-0687\\nPMID: 27172615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\",\n",

Despite intention to equalize opportunity \\nfor every child to have a healthy diet, USDA program rules may be contributing \\nto child obesity disparities and health inequity. USDA program rules require \\nchild care centers and schools to provide meals that include a specified number \\nof servings of particular types of foods and beverages. The rules are designed \\nfor the average, healthy weight child to maintain weight and growth. They are \\nnot designed for the underweight child to gain weight, obese child to normalize \\nweight, or pre-diabetic child to avoid incident diabetes. The rules allow for \\nonly one meal pattern and volume, as opposed to a flexible spectrum of meal \\npatterns and portion sizes. Parents of children who participate in the CACFP, \\nSBP, and/or NSLP do not have control over the amount or composition of the \\nsubsidized meals. Parents of overweight, obese, or diabetic children who \\nparticipate in the subsidized meal programs can request dietary change, special \\nmeals or accommodations to address their child\\'s health status, but child care \\nproviders and schools are not required to comply with the request unless a \\nlicensed physician signs a \"Medical statement to request special meals and/or \\naccommodations\". Although physicians are the only group authorized to change the \\nfoods, beverages, and portion sizes served daily to low income children, they \\nare not doing so. Over the past three years, despite an overweight and obesity \\nprevalence of 30% in San Francisco child care centers serving low income \\nchildren, zero medical statements were filed to request special meals or \\naccommodations to alter daily meals in order to prevent obesity, treat obesity, \\nor prevent postprandial hyperglycemia. Low income children have systematically \\nless dietary flexibility than higher income children, because of reliance on \\nfree or reduced-price meals, federal food program policy, and lack of awareness \\nthat only physicians have authority to alter the composition of subsidized meals \\nin child care centers and schools. Compared with higher income children, low \\nincome children do not have equal opportunity to change their daily dietary \\nintake to balance energy requirements.\\n\\nDOI: 10.16966/2380-5528.105\\nPMCID: PMC4844226\\nPMID: 27123492',\n",

Surgical reconstruction of \\nthe left pulmonary artery was then often attempted but was difficult or \\nimpossible in some of the patients with hypoplasia of the left pulmonary artery \\nand the left lung.\\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old girl presented with marked exercise intolerance \\nand palpitations and was diagnosed to have large PDA. She had feeding \\ndifficulty, diaphoresis, failure to gain weight, recurrent chest infections \\nduring infancy and early childhood. Physical examination revealed an underweight \\nchild with wide pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses. She had active \\nprecordium with accentuated P2 and machinery murmur in the left 2nd intercostal \\nspace and mid diastolic rumble at the mitral area. Echocardiography showed a \\n12\\xa0mm patent arterial duct. She was taken for an intended surgical ligation of \\nthe duct but a control echocardiogram on the 3rd postoperative day revealed that \\nthe left pulmonary artery, instead of the duct, was ligated. Surgical \\nreconstruction of the left pulmonary artery was undertaken 3\\xa0years later, \\nhowever, this was complicated by post reconstruction left pulmonary artery \\nstenosis. Successful percutaneous stenting of the left pulmonary artery was \\nperformed 18\\xa0months after the surgical reconstruction.\\nCONCLUSION: The incidence of inadvertent LPA ligation may be underestimated \\nwhere PDA ligation is done by less experienced surgeons and postoperative \\nechocardiography is not routinely performed. Late correction of inadvertent LPA \\nligation is an important surgical challenge, especially if the duct is still \\npatent. Percutaneous stenting as a primary option may carry significant risk, as \\nthe ligated pulmonary artery is fragile. In our case, a good result was achieved \\nwith surgical repair followed by percutaneous stenting.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1186/s13104-015-1467-3\\nPMCID: PMC4588232\\nPMID: 26423273 [Indexed for MEDLINE]',\n",

This \\nstudy aimed to identify the presence of DBM at the community and household \\nlevels in Orang Asli population and its associated demographic and \\nsocio-economic factors.\\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 Orang Asli villages \\nsurrounding the Krau Wildlife Reserve, Peninsular of Malaysia from October 2011 \\nto January 2012. Of 438 households, a total of 981 adults and 304 children who \\nmet the study criteria agreed to participate. About 160 households were further \\nselected with pairs of children aged 3-59 months and non-pregnant mothers aged \\n15-55 years. Demographic and socio-economic data were obtained using \\ninterviewer-administered questionnaire while weight and height were measured \\nusing standard procedures. Double-burden of malnutrition was defined as \\noverweight/obese mother-underweight child (OWOBM/UWC), overweight/obese \\nmother-stunted child (OWOBM/STC) or overweight/obese mother-underweight or/and \\nstunted child (OWOBM/UWSTC). Binary logistic regression identified the \\ndemographic and socio-economic factors associated with double-burden households.\\nRESULTS: About 26 % of overweight and obese adults coexisting with high \\nproportions of underweight (49%) and stunted (64%) children in these Orang Asli \\nvillages. There was a higher prevalence of households with OWOBM/UWSTC (20%) and \\nOWOBM/STC (19.4%) than households with OWOBM/UWC (12.5%). Boys (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), older \\nage mothers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), mothers with higher education (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and households \\nwith income per capita less than USD 29.01 (RM 97.00) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) were associated \\nwith higher odds of OWOBM/STC.

A large decrease in undernutrition in adults was \\nobserved from 1974-1975 to 1989. In children <5 y of age, no increase in the \\nprevalence of overweight across the analyzed periods was observed, whereas a \\nmajor decrease in the prevalence of undernutrition was detected from 1996 to \\n2006-2007.

The eating of high fat, high caloric diets, the \\npresence of inactive entertainment devices and mechanized labour influence \\npatterns of food demand and physical activity. This study identified factors \\nassociated with the occurrence of under/overweight or normal/normal nutritional \\nstatus of child-mother pairs in one household. This study was conducted in two \\nphases. The first phase was a survey of 376 child-mother pairs. The children \\naged 33-83 months were attending classes in government day care centres. \\nAnthropometric indices: weight-for-age Z score (WAZ) < or = -2SD was used to \\nclassify underweight in children. WAZ+1 to -1SD was used to indicate normal \\nnutritional status in children, specifically for this study, in order to \\nestablish a more homogenous group. Body mass index (BMI) > or = 25 kg/m2 was \\nused to measure overweight among mothers. Results showed that about 59% of the \\nchild-mother pairs were suffering from two different types of malnutrition. From \\nthis, 31 (8.2%) child-mother pairs in the same household were experiencing \\nunderweight/overweight: the child was underweight and the mother was overweight. \\nThe second phase of the study was an in-depth study of these 31 under/overweight \\nchild-mother pairs and 30 randomly selected normal/normal pairs. Pre-tested \\nquestionnaires were used to gather socio-economic-demographic data; 3 day 24-h \\nfood recall for dietary intake and 24-h activity recall for physical activity. \\nResults showed that the different factors associated with the existence of \\nunderweight child/overweight mother (UC/OM) or normal child/normal mother \\n(NC/NM) in this study were: mother's educational level, mother's occupation, and \\nnumber of children in the household; energy intake, the preference of meats, \\nsweets and sugars among children or meats and fried foods among mothers; and \\nmother's perception on body size. Physical activity of both mothers and children \\nwas higher in the UC/OM than in the NC/NM group. The problem of undernutrition \\nand overnutrition in one household poses enormous challenges. Although this \\nstudy cannot make an inference to the whole population, the results indicate \\nthat there is a need to consider whether public health programs should focus on \\nhealthy diet and lifestyle patterns that will lead to optimal health outcomes at \\nboth ends of the spectrum of nutritional status.\\n\\nPMID: 14672868 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\",\n",

In Malaysia, the prevalence of \\nunderweight and stunting persist among young children from poor rural areas. \\nOverweight in adults, especially women from poor rural areas has been reported \\nin recent years. Thus, this study was undertaken in order to assess the presence \\nof the dual burden of underweight child-overweight mother pairs in a poor rural \\ncommunity. Out of 140 Malay households identified to have at least one child \\naged 1-6 years and mother aged above 20 years, 52.1% of the mothers were \\noverweight, 15.7% of the children were underweight, 27.1% stunted and 5% wasted. \\nSocio-economic background and food intake frequency data were collected from 54 \\nunderweight child/overweight mother pairs (UW/OW) and 41 normal weight \\nchild/normal weight mother pairs (NW/NW). Compared with the overweight mothers, \\na higher percentage of the normal weight mothers had received secondary \\neducation, were employed and with a higher household monthly income, although \\nthese differences were not significant. Patterns of food intake of the mothers \\nand children appeared to have more similarities than differences between the \\nUW/OW and NW/NW groups. Quantitative dietary intakes for 2 days using 24-hr \\nrecall and physical activity energy expenditure over the same period were \\nassessed in a sub-group of UW/OW and NW/NW mothers and children. The NW/NW \\nchildren showed significantly higher intake of total calories, fat and \\nriboflavin than the UW/OW counterparts. Mean energy and nutrient intake of \\nmothers from both groups were not significantly different, although the NW/NW \\nmothers showed higher intake adequacy for total calories and most nutrients. \\nWhile most of the mothers from both groups reported having no chronic illnesses, \\nabout half of the children in both groups had infections, especially \\ngastrointestinal infections, over a 2-week period. Energy expenditure from \\nphysical activity for both UW/OW and NW/NW mothers and children did not differ \\nsignificantly. This study confirmed inadequate intake of total energy and \\nnutrients as the major factor for underweight in Malay children from rural \\nareas. However, assessing intake and physical activity by interview methods were \\nnot sensitive enough to overcome perceived problems of under-reporting of energy \\nintake and over-estimation of energy expenditure, especially by overweight \\nsubjects. Further investigations on a larger sample are necessary to understand \\nthe family dynamics leading to the double burden of malnutrition within the same \\nhousehold.\\n\\nPMID: 14672867 [Indexed for MEDLINE]',\n",

In fact, \\nunderweight and overweight are thought of as resulting from very different \\nenvironmental, behavioral and individual risk factors. This study identified \\nhouseholds in which overweight and underweight coexist and explored \\nhousehold-level associations such as urban residence and income. Using three \\nlarge national surveys from Brazil, China and Russia, the prevalence of such \\nhouseholds ranged from 8% in China and Russia to 11% in Brazil. Even more \\nimportant from the public health perspective is the finding that these \\nunder/over households accounted for a high proportion of all households with an \\nunderweight member in China (23%), Brazil (45%), and Russia (58%). The \\nprevalence of the underweight/overweight household was highest in the urban \\nenvironment in all three countries. There was no clear pattern in the prevalence \\nof the underweight/overweight household type by income. Multivariable logistic \\nregression was used to test the significance of the association of household \\ntype with urban residence and income while controlling for household size and \\nhousehold demographics by gender. Further analysis was done to consider the age \\nrelationships within the underweight/overweight pair. The underweight child \\ncoexisting with an overweight nonelderly adult was the predominant pair \\ncombination in all three countries. These findings illustrate the need for \\npublic health programs that are able to address underweight and overweight \\nsimultaneously.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1093/jn/130.12.2965\\nPMID: 11110855 [Indexed for MEDLINE]',\n",

To determine if the clinical manifestations of specific types of \\ndiarrhoea differed according to the nutritional status or size (weight and \\nlength) of the patient, we studied children with acute diarrhoea associated with \\nrotavirus or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. In this study we found that a \\nchild's body size, which was determined by his age and nutritional status, was a \\nsignificant predictor of his rate of stool output per kilogram of body weight. \\nThus, children who are small because of young age and/or malnutrition appear to \\nlose a greater proportion of their total fluid volume during diarrhoea and might \\nbe expected to have a higher frequency of severe dehydration and death, if \\nuntreated.\\n\\nPIP: This study assessed the effects of undernutrition (measured by \\nweight-for-length) and low body weight on stool output rates in 82 children \\nunder 5 years of age with diarrhea associated with rotavirus or enterotoxigenic \\nEscherichia coli. Although weight-for-length status did not affect stool output, \\nchildren appeared to lose fluid as a greater rate if they had low body weight. \\nLower-weight children had rates of stool loss 14-61% greater than higher-weight \\nchildren. Multiple regressionanalysis aimed at determining whether age, weight, \\nor length was the best predictor of stool output found that length was the best \\npredictor. However, weight and age are likely to be indirectly related to \\ndiarrheal severity, since malnutrition and young age are reasons for smaller \\nbody weight or length. It is hypothesized that the small intestine of an \\nunderweight child is greater in proportion to body weight than that of a normal \\nweight child, resulting in larger stool losses per kg/body weight. The finding \\nthat children of small body size lose a greater proportion of their body fluid \\nduring diarrhea suggests that these children should be regarded as a high risk \\ngroup during diarrhea.
